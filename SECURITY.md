## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of DSM code and deployed systems seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our codebase, please report it to us following these steps:

1. **Do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed by our team.
2. Email your findings to `security@dsm-project.org`. If possible, encrypt your report using our PGP key (available on our website).
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggestions for mitigation or remediation

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will send a more detailed response indicating next steps within 72 hours.

After our initial reply, the security team will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement.

## Security Model

DSM (Decentralized State Machine) implements multiple layers of security:

### Cryptographic Foundations

- **Hash Chain Verification**: All state transitions are cryptographically linked in a verifiable hash chain
- **Quantum-Resistant Algorithms**: SPHINCS+ signatures provide post-quantum security
- **Multiple Cryptographic Primitives**: We utilize BLAKE3, SHA3, and other modern cryptographic algorithms

### Security Architecture

- **Deterministic State Transitions**: All operations produce deterministic, verifiable state changes
- **Defense-in-Depth**: Multiple validation layers for all operations
- **Secure Key Management**: Keys are protected using industry best practices

### Network Security

- **TLS Communication**: All network traffic is encrypted using modern TLS configurations
- **Certificate Verification**: Strong verification of peer certificates
- **Peer Authentication**: Cryptographic authentication of all peers

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying DSM, follow these best practices:

1. **Access Control**:
   - Run containers and services as non-root users
   - Apply the principle of least privilege
   - Use strong authentication for administrative access

2. **Network Configuration**:
   - Place nodes behind a firewall
   - Only expose necessary API endpoints
   - Use reverse proxies with proper TLS termination

3. **Key Management**:
   - Generate secure keys using hardware security modules when possible
   - Implement regular key rotation
   - Store keys securely, preferably in a key management system

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Enable logging for security events
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Set up alerts for potential security issues

5. **Updates**:
   - Keep all dependencies updated
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Follow our security announcements

## Security Features

### Content-Addressed Token Policy Anchor (CTPA)

The CTPA system provides secure policy verification for token operations:

- Policies are cryptographically bound to tokens
- Operations are verified against immutable policies
- Tampering with policies is detectable

### Quantum Resistance

DSM implements quantum-resistant cryptography:

- SPHINCS+ signatures for long-term security
- ML-KEM (Kyber) for key encapsulation
- Hybrid encryption modes for defense-in-depth

### Storage Security

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Storage nodes implement access controls
- Data is distributed across multiple nodes with integrity verification

## Security Development Lifecycle

Our development process includes:

1. **Secure Design**: Security considerations from initial architecture
2. **Code Review**: All code undergoes security-focused review
3. **Static Analysis**: Automated tools to detect security issues
4. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerabilities in dependencies
5. **Penetration Testing**: Periodic security testing
6. **Responsible Disclosure**: Process to handle reported vulnerabilities
