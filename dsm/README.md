# Decentralized State Machine (DSM)

## Secure. Deterministic. Evolving.

DSM is a quantum-resistant cryptographic engine designed for secure, state-based systems that operate both online and offline. It combines self-evolving identity, token transitions, and smart-commitments into a unified framework — without relying on traditional smart contracts or consensus mechanisms.

Whether you're building decentralized identity systems, offline-capable apps, or secure IoT protocols, DSM gives you complete control over your system's state with verifiability baked in.
