DSM: Decentralized State Machine
The Missing Trust Layer of the Internet
Brandon “Cryptskii” Ramsay

Abstract
The modern internet operates on layers of centralized trust, where
corporations, governments, and intermediaries control authentication,
identity, financial transactions, and ownership records. These struc-
tures introduce vulnerabilities, from censorship and fraud to secu-
rity breaches and institutional control. The Decentralized State Ma-
chine (DSM) eliminates these weaknesses by establishing a mathemat-
ically enforced trust layer that renders traditional consensus mecha-
nisms, trusted third parties, and intermediaries obsolete. DSM is a
decentralized, quantum-resistant system designed for digital identities
and tokens, enabling cryptographically secure state transitions with-
out the need for global consensus. By leveraging deterministic entropy
evolution, hierarchical identity structures, and post-quantum crypto-
graphic primitives, DSM provides offline capability, immediate final-
ity, forward-only state progression, and superior scalability compared
to traditional blockchains. Unlike smart contract platforms, DSM
eliminates the need for on-chain execution by allowing deterministic,
pre-commitment-based state transitions that support flexible, multi-
path workflows without requiring centralized computation. Addition-
ally, DSM achieves all of this while being non-Turing-complete,
which provides critical security, efficiency, and predictability benefits
that traditional smart contract systems lack. The protocol employs
a straight hash chain architecture for fundamental integrity verifica-
tion, augmented by a sparse index and Sparse Merkle Tree for efficient
lookups and proofs, ensuring computational integrity without sacrific-
ing privacy. Furthermore, DSM introduces a bilateral state isolation
model that eliminates synchronization overhead and provides inherent
consistency guarantees across intermittent interactions. The system’s
subscription-based economic model eliminates gas fees while maintain-
ing system sustainability. This document extensively outlines DSM’s
architecture, mathematics, cryptographic foundations, and practical
considerations, with examples illustrating both online and offline trans-
action flows and real-world applications.
DSM: Realizing the True Peer-to-Peer Vision of Bitcoin
In the original Bitcoin whitepaper, Satoshi Nakamoto outlined a vision
1
for a extitpurely peer-to-peer electronic cash system:
“A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash
would allow online payments to be sent directly from
one party to another without going through a finan-
cial institution.” ˜ Satoshi Nakamoto
However, while Bitcoin introduced decentralized money, it never
fully achieved this ideal due to structural limitations:
• Dependence on Miners: Transactions require validation from min-
ers through Proof-of-Work (PoW), creating a bottleneck that pre-
vents true instant, direct transactions.
• Global Consensus Requirement: Bitcoin maintains a single, shared
ledger that all nodes must agree upon, making scalability and ef-
ficiency problematic.
• Finality Delays: Bitcoin transactions require multiple confirma-
tions to be considered final, which introduces waiting times that
make microtransactions impractical.
• Limited Offline Capability: Transactions must be relayed through
an online network, meaning they cannot be finalized in a fully
offline setting. (Going beyond Satoshi’s vision)
Bitcoin’s second-layer solutions, such as the Lightning Network,
attempt to address some of these issues, but they fall short in key
ways:
• Liquidity Constraints: Lightning Network relies on pre-funded
channels, requiring liquidity locks that limit transaction freedom.
• Routing Problems: Payments require a successful routing path
between peers, meaning transactions can fail if liquidity is insuf-
ficient along the route.
• Centralization Risks: Large hubs become dominant liquidity providers,
introducing potential points of failure and censorship.
• Offline Transactions Are Not Truly Peer-to-Peer: A Lightning
payment still requires internet connectivity at some point to relay
and finalize transactions.
0.1 How DSM Achieves the Original Vision
DSM eliminates all of these limitations, making it the true realization
of Bitcoin’s original peer-to-peer model. Unlike Bitcoin or Lightning
Network, DSM transactions:
• Require no miners, no validators, and no global consensus.
• Are final instantly, as they rely on self-verifying cryptographic
state rather than waiting for confirmations.
• Allow for direct peer-to-peer transactions, even in a fully offline
setting.
2
• Have no liquidity constraints or routing dependencies, unlike the
Lightning Network.
• Are mathematically guaranteed, eliminating all forms of trust.
0.2 Offline Transactions: The True Digital Equiva-
lent of Cash
One of DSM’s most groundbreaking aspects is its ability to facilitate
fully offline transactions. Just as cash allows two individuals to ex-
change value without an intermediary, DSM enables direct peer-to-peer
transfers between two mobile devices:
1. Alice and Bob meet in person.
2. Alice pre-commits a transaction to Bob and transfers it via Blue-
tooth.
3. Bob verifies the transaction cryptographically, ensuring that Al-
ice’s funds are valid and that the state follows DSM’s determin-
istic evolution rules.
4. The transaction is finalized instantly between Alice and Bob,
without requiring an online check-in with a global network.
5. Later, when either party reconnects to the network, their state
synchronizes to ensure continuity, but the transaction remains
fully valid regardless.
6. This method not only achieves the directness and immediacy
of cash transactions, but it also ensures cryptographic integrity
without requiring internet connectivity. Unlike Bitcoin, which re-
lies on an online ledger, or Lightning, which requires pre-funded
channels and routing, DSM provides an elegant solution that
makes digital payments as seamless and trustless as physical cash
but without the possibility of counterfeit.
0.3 Privacy and Security: Achieving the Full Vi-
sion of Bitcoin
Privacy is another area where DSM fulfills Bitcoin’s intended role
more effectively than Bitcoin itself. While Bitcoin transactions are
pseudonymous, they are still recorded on a public ledger, making them
susceptible to chain analysis and surveillance. DSM enhances privacy
in several key ways:
• No Global Ledger: Since transactions are state-based rather than
globally recorded, there is no universal history of transactions to
analyze.
• Direct Peer-to-Peer Exchange: Transactions occur directly be-
tween users, eliminating the need for intermediaries who might
collect metadata.
• Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: DSM is secured with post-
quantum cryptographic primitives (SPHINCS+, Kyber, and Blake3),
ensuring privacy and security against future computational threats.
3
0.4 Mathematical Guarantees: A System Without
Trust
The final key breakthrough of DSM is that it operates entirely on
mathematical guarantees. Unlike blockchains, which rely on economic
incentives, miner honesty, and validator cooperation, DSM’s security
is enforced through deterministic cryptography:
“There is no trust required, because the system is inherently
incapable of producing invalid states.”
Every state transition in DSM is:
• Pre-committed, ensuring that all execution paths are determin-
istic and verifiable.
• Self-contained, meaning that verification does not depend on a
third-party consensus mechanism.
• Immutable, with no possibility for reorgs, rollbacks, or double-
spends.
With DSM, we finally achieve what Bitcoin was always meant to
be: a system where transactions are direct, trustless, and instant, all
while retaining the privacy and usability of physical cash. Unlike tradi-
tional blockchains, DSM does not require external validation, miners,
or staking systems—it is a pure, self-verifying cryptographic state ma-
chine that operates with absolute security and efficiency.
“Everything Bitcoin aspired to be, DSM actually is and
more.”

1 Introduction: The Broken State of Internet Trust
The internet, as it stands today, is built upon fragile networks of central-
ized trust models. Users rely on corporations, financial institutions, and
consensus-driven blockchain networks to authenticate identity, verify trans-
actions, and manage ownership. These systems introduce severe vulnerabili-
ties that undermine the original promise of a decentralized, user-empowering
internet:
• Third-Party Control – Governments and corporations act as gate-
keepers, controlling access to identity and financial networks.
• Data Breaches & Fraud – Passwords, authentication tokens, and
centralized identity stores are constantly at risk.
• Censorship & Financial Lockouts – Institutions can revoke access
to funds, services, and identity at will.
• Blockchain Consensus Bottlenecks – Traditional decentralized so-
lutions require energy-intensive mining, staking, and validator net-
works to establish transaction validity.
Traditional blockchain systems rely on consensus to prevent double-
spending and state manipulation. DSM replaces this with deterministic,
cryptographic state evolution, enabling offline verifiable identities and tokens
without consensus, significantly reducing overhead. By leveraging forward-
only deterministic state evolution, balance invariance, and bilateral transac-
tion isolation, DSM mathematically guarantees security, eliminating fraud,
double-spending, and unauthorized modifications.
The internet today operates fundamentally on an ”approval model”
where users:
• Request access to an account → A server approves (Google Auth,
OAuth, etc.).
• Request a transaction → A bank approves (Visa, PayPal, Stripe).
• Request a certificate →A Certificate Authority (CA) approves (TL-
S/SSL).
• Request a contract execution → A blockchain approves (miners,
validators).
This approval model is the root cause of:
• Censorship → If the ”approver” doesn’t like you, they just reject or
delay your request.
10
• Hackability → Attackers target approval systems (databases, cen-
tralized authentication, PKI, etc.).
• Fraud → The approval model allows forgery, social engineering, and
manipulation.
DSM introduces a completely new paradigm—a self-validating model
where:
• You don’t need permission.
• You don’t need a central authority.
• You don’t need to ask for access—you just prove that you already
have it.
Instead of ”requesting and waiting for approval,” you simply provide
the next valid cryptographic state, and the system instantly verifies it on
its own. DSM provides identity and token management without requiring
global consensus or continuous connectivity, suitable for IoT, mobile, and
offline environments. Each state is cryptographically bound to its predeces-
sor through a direct hash chain, making tampering practically impossible
through a verification mechanism that remains secure against quantum at-
tacks.
2 DSM: The Internet’s Missing Trust Layer
DSM (Decentralized State Machine) is a cryptographic framework that elim-
inates trust dependencies altogether. Unlike traditional systems that
require global consensus or external verification, DSM enforces correctness
at the individual transaction level. Each state transition is cryptographically
bound to the previous state, ensuring:
• No Forking, No Double-Spending – Transactions have exactly
one valid next state, making forking mathematically impossible.
• Self-Sovereign Identity & Ownership – No accounts, no pass-
words, no third-party approvals. Users control their own deterministic
identity state.
• Instant Finality, No Reversals – Transactions reach finality im-
mediately, with no need for external verification.
• Offline & Online Security – Transactions can be executed and veri-
fied without network synchronization, allowing for censorship-resistant
offline operation.
DSM replaces the internet’s reliance on trust with pure mathematical
certainty.

3 Verification Through Straight Hash Chain
The cornerstone of DSM’s verification mechanism is a quantum-resistant ap-
proach based on a straightforward hash chain. This represents a significant
refinement over more complex verification approaches, providing enhanced
simplicity, security, and efficiency while maintaining the fundamental cryp-
tographic guarantees required for robust state verification.
12
3.1 Core Verification Principle
The straight hash chain verification operates on the following fundamental
principle:
(Sn.prev hash== H(Sn−1)) (2)
1. Each state contains a cryptographic hash of its predecessor state:
Sn+1.prev hash= H(Sn) (1)
2. Verification of a chain segment occurs by confirming that each state
properly references its predecessor:
Verify(Si,Sj) =
j
n=i+1
3. The cryptographic hash function H creates an inherent temporal or-
dering without requiring explicit timestamps:
Si →Sj ⇐⇒ ∃a valid chain from Si to Sj (3)
This approach provides several critical advantages:
• Simplicity: The direct hash chain is conceptually straightforward and
eliminates complex index management.
• Security: Each state’s integrity depends only on fundamental cryp-
tographic hash functions.
• Temporal Ordering: The hash chain itself creates an immutable
sequence of events.
• Quantum Resistance: The security derives from cryptographic hash
functions rather than vulnerable asymmetric primitives.
3.2 Sparse Index and Efficient Lookups
While the straight hash chain provides the fundamental verification mech-
anism, efficient state retrieval requires additional infrastructure. DSM im-
plements a sparse index system that works alongside the hash chain:
1. The sparse index maintains checkpoints at regular intervals:
SI= {S0,Sk,S2k,...,Snk} (4)
where k is the checkpoint interval.
13
2. When retrieving a state Sm, the system finds the nearest checkpoint
Sik where ik<m:
GetCheckpoint(m) = max i (Sik) such that ik<m (5)
3. The chain is then traversed from the checkpoint to the target state:
Traverse(Sik,m) = [Sik,Sik+1,...,Sm] (6)
This sparse indexing approach allows for efficient state access without
sacrificing the security of the hash chain.
3.3 Sparse Merkle Tree for Inclusion Proofs
To complement the hash chain and sparse index, DSM utilizes a Sparse
Merkle Tree (SMT) for efficient inclusion proofs:
1. The SMT maintains a cryptographic commitment to all states:
SMTroot = H({H(S0),H(S1),...,H(Sn)}) (7)
2. The tree structure enables logarithmic-sized proofs that a specific state
exists in the canonical chain:
π= GenerateProof(SMT,H(Si)) (8)
3. Verification of inclusion requires only the root hash and the proof:
VerifyInclusion(SMTroot,H(Si),π) →{true,false} (9)
This SMT structure provides an efficient mechanism for proving state in-
clusion without requiring transmission of the entire state chain, significantly
enhancing performance in distributed environments.
3.4 Distributed Hash Chain Architecture with Bilateral State
Isolation
A fundamental architectural characteristic of the DSM protocol is its dis-
tributed state management model, wherein each participating entity (user,
device, or counterparty) maintains its own sovereign hash chain with corre-
sponding verification infrastructure. Crucially, this distributed architecture
implements bilateral state isolation, where each relationship between entities
forms a distinct, encapsulated state progression context:
14
1. Entity-Specific State Chains: Each entity Ei in the system main-
tains a discrete, independent hash chain of states:
ChainEi
= {SEi
0 ,SEi
1 ,SEi
2 ,...,SEi
n } (10)
where SEi
j represents state j in entity Ei’s chain.
2. Bilateral Relationship Encapsulation: For any pair of entities Ei
and Ej, their interaction generates a relationship-specific set of states
that exist exclusively in the context of their bilateral relationship:
RelEi,Ej
= {(SEi
m1 ,SEj
p1 ),(SEi
m2 ,SEj
p2 ),...,(SEi
mk ,SEj
pk )} (11)
where (SEi
mt ,SEj
pt ) represents the t-th transaction state pair between
entities Ei and Ej.
3. Per-Entity Verification Structures: Each entity independently
maintains its own sparse index and Sparse Merkle Tree:
SIEi
= {SEi
0 ,SEi
k ,SEi
2k,...,SEi
nk} (12)
SMTEi,root= H({H(SEi
0 ),H(SEi
1 ),...,H(SEi
n )}) (13)
4. Relationship-Specific State Progression: When entities Ei and
Ej resume interaction after a period of separation, their state pro-
gression continues precisely from their last shared transaction state
pair:
NextInteraction(Ei,Ej) →(SEi
mk +1,SEj
pk +1) given LastInteraction(Ei,Ej) = (SEi
mk ,SEj
pk )
(14)
This bilateral state isolation architecture eliminates the need for global
state synchronization or catch-up mechanisms typically found in blockchain
systems. Each relationship exists in its own encapsulated context, with
state progression continuing precisely from where it left off, regardless of
intervening time or other entity interactions. This architectural approach
offers several critical advantages:
• Inherent Consistency: The bilateral nature of relationships en-
sures that state progression is always consistent between counterpar-
ties without requiring complex synchronization protocols.
• Zero Catch-up Overhead: When counterparties resume interaction,
there is no need to ”catch up” on state changes, as their relationship
picks up precisely where it left off, with the exact state pair from their
last interaction.
15
• Perfect State Continuity: Each relationship maintains perfect state
continuity regardless of how much time has elapsed between interac-
tions or how many other transactions entities have conducted with
other counterparties.
• Sovereignty: Each entity maintains complete control over its own
state evolution across all relationships.
• Privacy by Architecture: State information is compartmentalized
by default, with natural relationship boundaries preventing informa-
tion leakage between unrelated counterparties.
• Resilience: Compromise of one relationship’s state does not affect
others, creating strong isolation properties.
• Offline Capability: Entities can verify and evolve relationship states
without global connectivity, requiring only bilateral communication.
3.4.1 Cross-Chain Verification with State Continuity Guarantees
The cross-chain verification protocol exploits the bilateral state isolation
property to provide robust state continuity guarantees:
1. Initial Counterparty Verification: When entity Ei first encounters
entity Ej, Ei must obtain and verify Ej’s genesis state SEj
0 :
VerifyGenesisEi→Ej (SEj
0 ) (15)
2. Relationship Initialization: The first transaction establishes the
initial relationship state pair:
Init(Ei,Ej) →(SEi
m1 ,SEj
p1 ) (16)
3. Relationship State Persistence: Each entity persistently stores the
last state pair for each counterparty relationship:
StoreEi (Ej,SEi
mk ,SEj
pk ) (17)
4. Relationship Resumption: When interaction resumes, each entity
retrieves the last known state pair and continues from there:
Resume(Ei,Ej) →(SEi
mk ,SEj
pk ) →(SEi
mk +1,SEj
pk +1) (18)
This protocol leverages the isolated nature of bilateral relationships to
ensure perfect state continuity without synchronization overhead.
16
3.4.2 Technical Implementation Considerations
The implementation of this distributed, bilaterally isolated hash chain ar-
chitecture requires specific technical approaches:
• Counterparty State Caching: Efficient mechanisms for persistently
caching the last verified state for each counterparty relationship.
• Relationship-Keyed Storage: Data structures that organize state
information keyed by counterparty identity rather than global state
indices.
• Genesis Authentication Protocol: Robust protocols for initial
genesis state verification that can operate both online (leveraging di-
rectory services) and offline (through counterparty genesis caching).
• Relationship Resume Protocol: Efficient protocols for validating
and resuming relationship state when counterparties reconnect after
separation.
• Bilateral Transaction Atomicity: Mechanisms ensuring that state
transitions in both counterparty chains occur atomically within the
relationship context.
The DSM reference implementation provides standardized components
addressing these considerations, ensuring consistent behavior across varied
deployment environments while maintaining the core bilateral state isolation
property that eliminates synchronization overhead.
3.5 Security Properties
The security of the straight hash chain with sparse indexing and SMT sup-
port depends on several mathematical properties:
• Hash Chain Integrity: The integrity of the chain relies on the col-
lision resistance of the hash function:
Pr[∃(Si ̸= Sj) : H(Si) = H(Sj)] ≤ε (19)
where ε is a negligible function.
• Sparse Index Security: The sparse index serves only as an op-
timization and does not impact the security of the underlying hash
chain.
• SMT Proof Soundness: The SMT inclusion proofs are sound, mean-
ing that:
VerifyInclusion(SMTroot,H(Si),π) = true⇒Si ∈Chain (20)
17
• Bilateral Isolation Integrity: The relationship-specific state pairs
ensure that interactions between entities Ei and Ej cannot be influ-
enced by their separate interactions with other entities:
∀Ek ̸= Ej : RelEi,Ek ∩RelEi,Ej
= ∅ (21)
3.6 Implementation Considerations
The implementation of the straight hash chain verification system must bal-
ance several practical considerations:
• Hash Algorithm Selection: The hash function must be quantum-
resistant and highly efficient, with Blake3 being the current recom-
mended implementation.
• Checkpoint Frequency: The sparse index checkpoint interval should
balance storage overhead with lookup efficiency.
• SMT Configuration: The Sparse Merkle Tree implementation should
be optimized for the expected state distribution.
• Proof Caching: Frequently accessed inclusion proofs should be cached
to minimize computational overhead.
• Relationship Metadata Indexing: Efficient indexing of relation-
ship metadata is essential for quick counterparty state retrieval during
interaction resumption.
The DSM reference implementation standardizes these parameters in the
SDK to ensure consistent verification across all applications in the ecosys-
tem.

day’s Internet

DSM is not an incremental improvement—it is a foundational shift away
from consensus-based security models to a system where only mathemati-
cally valid state transitions can exist. This represents the elimination of the
internet’s biggest security flaws by:
• Replacing the entire authentication layer of the internet (No
passwords, no centralized logins).
• Replacing digital identity and certificate systems (No CAs, no
OAuth, no FIDO2).
• Replacing centralized payment networks (No banks, no charge-
backs, no PayPal).
• Replacing blockchain consensus-based security (No mining, no
staking, no validators).
• Replacing third-party custody models (No banks, no exchanges,
no intermediaries).
5 Trustless Genesis State Creation
Genesis state S0 creation relies on Blind Multiparty Computation (MPC),
implementing a threshold-based cryptographic protocol that ensures dis-
tributed trust during identity origination.
High-Level: The protocol prohibits any single entity from unilaterally
creating or controlling an identity genesis, thereby eliminating central points
of failure and establishing a foundation for genuine decentralization at the
19
protocol’s cryptographic core. The implementation utilizes post-quantum
primitives including BLAKE3, SPHINCS+, and Kyber for long-term secu-
rity.
5.1 Technical Details
Consider a set of participants P= {p1,p2,...,pn}, where each participant
pi contributes to the genesis formation through the following process:
bi = H(si ∥ri) (22)
Where:
• si represents a secret value known only to participant pi
• ri denotes a cryptographically secure random blinding factor
• ∥signifies concatenation of binary values
• H represents a post-quantum secure cryptographic hash function
The aggregated Genesis State is constructed as:
S0 = H(bi1 ∥bi2 ∥...∥bit ∥A), (23)
where t represents a threshold value such that t ≤|P|, ensuring that no
subset of participants smaller than tcan exercise unilateral control over gen-
esis creation. The additional parameter A incorporates application-specific
metadata into the genesis state construction.
The initial entropy seed is subsequently derived as:
e0 = H(S0 ∥bi1 ∥bi2 ∥...∥bit ) (24)
This construction ensures that the initial entropy for the system inherits
the distributed trust properties established during genesis creation, provid-
ing a cryptographically sound foundation for subsequent state transitions.
5.2 Quantum-Resistant Genesis and Token Creation
The Genesis state creation and token issuance in DSM involve specific cryp-
tographic techniques that must be performed online while ensuring quantum
resistance.
20
5.2.1 Pedersen Commitments in Genesis Creation
The DSM system employs a modified Pedersen commitment scheme sand-
wiched between quantum-resistant hash functions to protect against discrete
logarithm vulnerabilities:
1. Each participant in the Genesis MPC first generates their contribution.
2. This contribution is processed through SHA-3.
3. The result then enters a Pedersen commitment scheme, which remains
the only component vulnerable to discrete logarithm attacks.
4. The output is immediately processed through Blake3.
5. This ”hash sandwich” technique effectively protects the discrete loga-
rithm vulnerability in the Pedersen commitment.
The complete pipeline can be expressed as:
Final Contribution= Blake3(Pedersen Commit(SHA-3(participant contribution)))
(25)
5.2.2 Online Requirements for Critical Operations
Several critical operations in DSM must be performed while online:
1. Genesis State Creation: Requires multiple participants to be si-
multaneously online to contribute to the MPC process, ensuring no
single party can unilaterally create identities.
2. Adding New Counterparties: When adding a new transaction
partner, their Genesis state must be verified through the decentralized
storage while online. This verification cannot be performed offline,
as there would be no secure way to validate the authenticity of their
Genesis state.
3. Token Creation: Similar to Genesis creation, token issuance requires
online verification through the MPC process. Each token creation
event must be published to the decentralized storage to prevent double-
issuance.
This architecture ensures that while day-to-day transactions can occur
offline, the foundational security operations (Genesis, counterparty verifi-
cation, token creation) maintain their integrity through online validation,
with quantum resistance provided by the strategic implementation of mul-
tiple cryptographic primitives.
21
Additionally, when a user retrieves and verifies a Genesis state while
online, a local copy must be cached for later offline use. This is mandatory
and the only way to ensure offline transactions can proceed. Without a
cached Genesis state, transactions cannot be initiated or verified offline.
Furthermore, new contacts cannot be added for transactions while offline;
they must be verified through decentralized storage while online.
6 Hierarchical Merkle Tree for Device-Specific Iden-
tity Management
DSM implements a hierarchical identity structure using Merkle trees, en-
abling efficient management of multiple device-specific sub-identities that
are cryptographically tied to a single master Genesis state. This structure
provides significant advantages for multi-device scenarios while maintaining
security guarantees.
6.1 Device-Specific Sub-Genesis States
Rather than requiring separate Genesis states for each device, DSM allows
the generation of device-specific sub-Genesis states derived from a master
Genesis state:
Sdevice
0 = H(Smaster
0 ∥DeviceID∥device specific entropy) (26)
Where:
• Smaster
0 is the master Genesis state created through the MPC process
• DeviceIDis derived from device-specific entropy and application con-
text
• device specific entropy is locally generated entropy for the specific
device
6.2 Merkle Tree Structure
The sub-Genesis states are organized in a Merkle tree structure, with the
master Genesis state as the root:
MerkleRoot= H(H(Sdevice1
0 ) ∥H(Sdevice2
0 ) ∥...∥H(SdeviceN
0 )) (27)
This tree structure enables:
• Efficient verification of device sub-identities against the master identity
• Cryptographic proof of relationship between device identities
• Granular device-specific revocation and management
22
6.3 Cross-Device Hash Chain Validation
The hierarchical Merkle structure significantly enhances the efficiency of
cross-device hash chain validation:
1. Cross-Device Verification: A transaction can be verified against
any device’s state chain by traversing the Merkle tree, requiring only
O(log d) additional operations, where d is the number of devices.
2. Device-Specific Chain Validation: Each device maintains its own
independent hash chain with associated sparse index and SMT struc-
tures:
Chaindevicei
= {Sdevicei
0 ,Sdevicei
1 ,Sdevicei
2 ,...,Sdevicei
n } (28)
3. Hierarchical Chain Relationships: The master identity crypto-
graphically binds all device-specific chains within a unified verification
framework:
Verifymaster(devicei) = VerifyProof(MerkleRoot,Sdevicei
0 ,πdevicei )
(29)
6.4 Enhanced Recovery Mechanisms
The hierarchical structure enables more robust and efficient recovery mech-
anisms:
1. Device-Specific Invalidation: If a single device is compromised, an
invalidation marker can target that specific device without affecting
other devices:
I(Sdevice
k ) = (k,H(Sdevice
k ),edevice
k ,σI,m,DeviceID) (30)
2. Partial Recovery: Instead of recovering the entire identity, only
the compromised device’s hash chain needs to be recovered, reducing
recovery overhead.
3. Cross-Device Recovery: A valid device can help generate recov-
ery information for a compromised device, using shared cryptographic
material from the master Genesis state.
4. Graduated Recovery: The system supports multiple levels of re-
covery, from device-specific to complete identity recovery, with corre-
sponding security requirements.
23
6.5 Implementation Considerations
The Merkle tree structure requires additional considerations:
• Tree Balancing: Ensuring the Merkle tree remains balanced as de-
vices are added or removed
• Merkle Proof Caching: Devices should cache Merkle proofs of their
relationship to the master identity for offline verification
• Tree Synchronization: When online, devices should synchronize
their view of the Merkle tree to ensure consistent verification
• Privacy Protection: The Merkle structure should be designed to
prevent correlation of different device identities by third parties
This hierarchical approach enables DSM to scale efficiently across mul-
tiple devices while maintaining the core security properties of deterministic
state evolution and offline capability, making it particularly well-suited for
IoT ecosystems, enterprise identity management, and personal multi-device
environments.
7 State Evolution and Key Rotation
State transitions follow deterministic entropy evolution, establishing a forward-
only cryptographic progression that enforces temporal sequentiality and im-
mutability through mathematical invariants.
High-Level: Every transaction evolves state entropy deterministically
through a unidirectional cryptographic transformation. Ephemeral keys pre-
vent reuse of cryptographic material, ensuring forward-only evolution and
mitigating replay vectors through temporal binding.
Technical: State evolution follows a deterministic hash chain mathe-
matical function:
en+1 = H(en ∥opn+1 ∥(n+ 1)) (31)
Post-quantum key encapsulation (implemented via Kyber KEM):
(sharedn+1,encapsulatedn+1) = KyberEnc(pkr,en+1) (32)
Derived entropy for subsequent state operations:
′
e
n+1 = H(sharedn+1) (33)
24
7.1 Inherent Temporal Ordering Through Cryptographic Chain-
ing
A notable property of DSM’s state evolution mechanism is the inherent tem-
poral ordering that emerges from the cryptographic chaining of states. Each
state must reference its predecessor through a hash, creating an inviolable
”happens-before” relationship:
Sn+1 = H(Sn ∥opn+1 ∥σC) (34)
This creates a natural temporal ordering without requiring an explicit
consensus-based timestamp mechanism. The properties of this ordering in-
clude:
• Cryptographic Causality: Each state mathematically depends on
all previous states, creating an immutable causal chain
• Self-Enforcing Sequence: The state number (n+ 1) inherently ver-
ifies its position in the sequence
• Double-Spending Prevention: The unidirectional nature of state
evolution mathematically prevents fork attempts
For specific time-sensitive operations like expiring commitments, times-
tamps are still included in the state, but the fundamental ordering of trans-
actions comes from the cryptographic structure itself rather than from con-
sensus on time.
8 Pre-Signature Commitments and Fork Preven-
tion
High-Level: DSM prevents forks through a cryptographic commitment
protocol that requires transaction intents (particularly in offline mode) to
be mathematically committed beforehand by both sender and recipient, es-
tablishing a bifurcation-resistant transaction graph.
8.1 Mechanism and Technical Details
Pre-commitment with hash chain validation functions via the following quantum-
resistant construction:
Cpre = H(H(Sn) ∥opn+1 ∥en+1) (35)
The protocol requires both sender and recipient to independently verify
the commitment hash and apply their respective cryptographic signatures.
25
The final state transition must demonstrably match the commitment struc-
ture to finalize the transaction. In online operational mode, real-time ver-
ification serves as a replacement for explicit pre-commitments, though the
mathematical properties remain invariant.
8.2 Why Pre-Commitments Are Necessary
Pre-commitments ensure that every transaction is logically interlocked
with the next one, eliminating any opportunity for state divergence. With-
out them:
• A sender could create multiple conflicting state transitions and at-
tempt to finalize different versions depending on the context.
• Recipients would have to verify not only the immediate state but also
whether an alternative conflicting state exists, adding complexity and
attack surfaces.
• In offline transactions, where real-time verification isn’t possible, pre-
commitments ensure that any transaction already has a locked-in for-
ward path before the previous state finalizes.
• This prevents malicious rollbacks or parallel state forks, enforcing
cryptographic integrity in an asynchronous, decentralized envi-
ronment.
• The pre-commitment process eliminates uncertainty in the next
transition, ensuring both parties know what must happen next, re-
ducing negotiation complexity.
8.3 Forward-Linked Transaction Pre-Commitments
A distinctive security feature of the DSM protocol is the implementation of
forward-linked pre-commitments, wherein transaction participants establish
cryptographic commitments to anticipated future transaction parameters
during the finalization of their current transaction. This mechanism creates
an unbroken chain of cryptographic intents that significantly enhances the
protocol’s resistance to state manipulation and fork attacks.
8.3.1 Technical Implementation
When parties A and B engage in transaction Tn, they simultaneously ne-
gotiate and cryptographically commit to non-variable parameters of their
anticipated subsequent transaction Tn+1:
Cfuture= H(Sn+1 ∥counterpartyid ∥fixed parameters∥{variable parameters})
(36)
26
where:
• Sn+1 is the state that will result from the current transaction
• fixed parametersrepresents the invariant aspects of the future trans-
action
• {variable parameters}denotes parameter placeholders that remain
unspecified (particularly transaction amounts)
Both parties generate partial signatures over this commitment:
σA,future= SignskA (Cfuture) (37)
σB,future= SignskB (Cfuture) (38)
These partial signatures are embedded within the current state transi-
tion, creating an immutable reference to the parameters of the anticipated
future transaction:
Sn+1 = (e
′
n+1,encapsulatedn+1,Tn+1,Bn+1,H(Sn),opn+1,Cfuture,σA,future,σB,future)
(39)
8.3.2 Hash Chain Verification for Forward Commitments
The forward commitment is secured through straight hash chain validation:
Verify(Cfuture) = (H(Cfuture ∥en+1) == Cfuture.hash) (40)
This hash chain validation serves as a compact, quantum-resistant ver-
ification mechanism for the future transaction parameters, allowing both
parties to confirm the integrity of their shared intent without revealing all
details.
8.3.3 Security Implications
This forward-linking mechanism establishes several critical security proper-
ties:
• Fork Resistance: Any attempt to create a divergent state branch
would require simultaneously forging valid signatures from both coun-
terparties on both the current and forward commitments, exponen-
tially increasing attack complexity.
• Transaction Continuity: The explicit linkage between sequential
transactions creates a cryptographically verifiable transaction narra-
tive that can be independently validated by participating parties.
27
• Parameter Flexibility: By leaving transaction amounts and other
variable parameters unspecified, the system maintains operational flex-
ibility while still securing the transaction structure.
• Non-Repudiation of Intent: Both parties establish cryptographic
proof of their intention to engage in a subsequent transaction with
specific parameters, preventing later repudiation of the agreed terms.
8.3.4 Mathematical Security Analysis
The security of the forward-linked commitment mechanism can be formally
expressed through the probability of a successful fork attack:
P(fork) ≤P(forge signature A)·P(forge signature B)
·P(forge hash chain)·P(forge forward commitment) (41)
Given the multiplicative relationship between these already negligible prob-
abilities, the resulting security margin exceeds that of traditional blockchain
systems by several orders of magnitude, particularly against quantum com-
putational threats.
8.3.5 Integration with State Evolution
Each new transaction must adhere to the parameters established in the
preceding forward commitment, or explicitly invoke a renegotiation protocol
that requires mutual consent. This creates a deterministic state evolution
path where:
∀Tn : Parameters(Tn) ⊆Cfuture(Tn−1) ∨Renegotiate(Tn) (42)
The combination of forward-linked pre-commitments with straight hash
chain verification creates a quantum-resistant transaction continuity model
that eliminates entire classes of attack vectors present in traditional blockchain
architectures, while maintaining flexibility for legitimate transaction flow
adaptations.
9 Transaction Workflow Examples
To illustrate how DSM works in practice, we present examples for both
online and offline transactions, highlighting the fundamental architectural
differences in state transition verification requirements.
28
9.1 Example 1: Unilateral Transaction (Online Directory)
4a. Immediate notification (if online)
4. Sync to inbox
3. Finalize & broadcast
1. Request Bob’s Genesis
Alice Directory Bob
2. Send SBob
0
Figure 1: Unilateral Transaction Flow (Online Directory)
Step 1: Alice wants to send tokens to Bob. She requests Bob’s Genesis
state SBob
0 from the directory.
Step 2: Alice verifies Bob’s Genesis state and constructs a transaction:
opn+1 = “transfer 10 tokens to Bob” en+1 = H(en ∥opn+1 ∥(n+ 1)) (43)
(44)
Step 3: Alice finalizes the transaction unilaterally, creating state Sn+1
and broadcasts it to the directory:
Sn+1 = (e
′
n+1,encapsulatedn+1,Tn+1,Bn+1−10,H(Sn),opn+1) (45)
Step 4: The transaction is stored in Bob’s inbox within the directory. If
Bob is currently online, he will receive immediate notification and can sync
29
the transaction immediately; otherwise, he will retrieve and verify it when
he next connects to the network. In either case, the transaction is already
finalized and cryptographically valid regardless of Bob’s online status or
actions.
9.2 Example 2: Bilateral Transaction (Direct Offline Ex-
change)
3. Finalize transaction
1. Pre-commit with hash value
Alice Bob
2. Verify hash and co-sign
4. (Later) Broad-
cast to network
4. (Later) Broad-
cast to network
Figure 2: Bilateral Transaction Flow (Direct Offline Exchange)
Step 1: Alice generates a pre-commitment hash:
Cpre = H(H(Sn) ∥“transfer 10 tokens to Bob” ∥en+1) (46)
Step 2: Bob receives the transaction details and independently cal-
culates the same hash. Upon successfully matching the hash value, Bob
co-signs the commitment without needing to reveal all transaction data.
Step 3: Alice constructs the complete state Sn+1 with final balance and
timestamp, including Bob’s signature:
Sn+1 = ( e
′
n+1, encapsulatedn+1, Tn+1, Bn−1−10,
H(Sn), “transfer 10 tokens to Bob”, σBob) (47)
Bob can immediately verify and accept the transaction offline by recalculat-
ing the hash and confirming it matches the pre-commitment.
Step 4: When either party reconnects to the network, they broadcast
the new state to the directory.
30
Note: If Bob had previously verified Alice’s Genesis state while online,
he must have cached it for reference. This is not optional—offline trans-
actions cannot proceed without a verified and cached Genesis state. Bob
cannot add Alice as a new transaction contact while offline; this must be
done while online.
9.3 Architectural Rationale for Bilateral Signatures in Of-
fline Mode
The requirement for Bob’s signature in the offline scenario provides critical
security guarantees that would otherwise be unavailable without directory
validation:
1. Proximity-Based Security Enhancement: In offline scenarios,
participants are typically in physical proximity (face-to-face interac-
tion), making bilateral signature collection both practical and security-
enhancing. Since both parties are already present, obtaining this ad-
ditional cryptographic assurance adds minimal friction while signifi-
cantly enhancing security.
2. Double-Spending Prevention: Without the directory’s authorita-
tive state verification available in online unilateral transactions, of-
fline bilateral transactions require dual signatures to mathematically
prevent double-spending attacks. The bilateral signature requirement
creates a cryptographic witness to the transaction, ensuring that when
later synchronized with the network, conflicting transactions can be
deterministically resolved.
3. Transaction Repudiation Protection: The co-signature creates
non-repudiation guarantees that prevent either party from later claim-
ing the transaction was unauthorized or manipulated, which is partic-
ularly important when transactions occur outside the network’s obser-
vation boundary.
4. Attestation of State Observation: By signing the transaction, Bob
cryptographically attests that he has observed Alice’s current state,
providing verification that would otherwise come from the directory
in online unilateral scenarios.
This architectural distinction—unilateral for online directory-mediated
transactions versus bilateral for direct offline exchanges—represents a care-
fully calibrated balance between security, usability, and offline capability in
the DSM protocol design. The system dynamically selects the appropri-
ate transaction mode based on network connectivity status, defaulting to
the more secure bilateral protocol when operating in disconnected environ-
ments. Note: If Bob had previously verified Alice’s Genesis state while
31
online, he must have cached it for reference. This is not optional—offline
transactions cannot proceed without a verified and cached Genesis state.
Bob cannot add Alice as a new transaction contact while offline; this must
be done while online.
9.4 Example 3: Advanced Offline Pokemon Trading with
Pre-Commitment Hashing
DSM is particularly well-suited for location-based augmented reality games
like Pokemon GO, where players may frequently experience connectivity is-
sues. In this enhanced example, players exchange cryptographic hash values
derived from their trade details, preserving privacy while ensuring integrity.
1. Offer Pokemon trade (sends hash value)
3. Finalize trade via state update
Player 1 Player 2
Local Connection (Bluetooth/NFC)
2. Verify locally and co-sign
4. (Later) Sync with server 4. (Later) Sync with server
Game Server
Figure 3: Enhanced Pokemon GO Offline Trading with Hash Chain Verifi-
cation
Key Concept: Rather than sending complete trade details in plain text,
each player: 1. Locally combines the trade parameters (offered Pokemon,
32
requested Pokemon, trade ID, etc.) 2. Generates a cryptographic hash of
these parameters 3. Exchanges only the hash value for verification
This approach preserves privacy while providing cryptographic proof of
transaction details.
Workflow:
1. Trade Initiation:
Player 1 collects the trade details and computes:
Ctrade = H “Player1: Pikachu, Player2: Charmander, TradeID XYZ”
∥Sn ∥(n+ 1)
(48)
Player 1 signs the hash value with her private key.
2. Offline Exchange: Using local communication (Bluetooth/NFC),
Player 1 sends the hash value along with her signature to Player 2.
The full trade details remain private and stored only on the players’
devices.
3. Verification and Co-Signing: Player 2’s application independently
generates the hash from his local copy of the trade parameters. If the
hash values match, Player 2 co-signs the pre-commitment.
4. Finalization: The finalized pre-commitment (which includes both
signatures) is used to deterministically update both players’ DSM
states. This update securely transfers Pikachu from Player 1 to Player
2 (and vice versa if applicable).
5. Deferred Synchronization: When connectivity is restored, the new
state is synchronized with the game server for global verification.
9.5 Implementation Details (Pseudocode)

10 Token Management and Atomic State Updates
High-Level: Token operations and identity states in DSM evolve atomi-
cally through cryptographically-enforced mechanisms, ensuring consistency
and immutability across state transitions. This atomicity is mathematically
guaranteed through the indivisible cryptographic binding of balance updates
to state transitions.
Technical: Token balance updates are integrated directly in the state
transition through a mathematical invariant that ensures conservation of
value:
Bn+1 = Bn + ∆n+1, Bn+1 ≥0 (49)
The constraint Bn+1 ≥0 enforces a system-wide conservation property
that mathematically prevents overdraws or balance fabrication. The inte-
grated state construction forms a unified cryptographic entity:
Sn+1 = (e
′
n+1,encapsulatedn+1,Tn+1,Bn+1,H(Sn),opn+1) (50)
This construction ensures that any tampering with token balances would
invalidate the cryptographic state transition, making balance falsification
36
equivalent in difficulty to breaking the underlying cryptographic primitives.
Furthermore, in the context of a token transfer operation (such as ”transfer
10 tokens to Bob”), the balance change would be explicitly represented:
∆n+1 =−10 (for sender) and ∆n+1 = +10 (for recipient) (51)
Ensuring that the sum of all ∆ values across a transaction equals zero,
mathematically guaranteeing conservation of token supply across the system.
11 Eliminating the Account Model: A New Inter-
net Paradigm
The existing internet architecture relies heavily on a centralized account-
based model where:
• Financial institutions control your bank account and can unilaterally
freeze or confiscate assets.
• Technology corporations control your Google/social media accounts
and can suspend or delete them at will.
• Service providers control your account credentials and can revoke
access.
• Even cryptocurrency exchanges control your exchange wallets, main-
taining custody over cryptographic assets.
In essence, your digital identity is merely a mutable record in a third-
party system that can be modified, revoked, or blocked without recourse
or consent.
DSM fundamentally replaces this paradigm with ”cryptographic self-
sovereignty.” In this architecture:
• The traditional ”account” concept is eliminated—your identity ex-
ists as a continuously evolving cryptographic state under your
exclusive control.
• Your balance, credentials, and data exist within your self-contained
identity state—not as external records in third-party databases.
• No external entity can alter, lock, or remove your state because state
transitions follow mathematically enforced, unidirectional cryp-
tographic progression.
This represents a fundamental paradigm shift where authentication is
no longer dependent on external service providers but is instead a mathe-
matical proof of cryptographic ownership. Access control transforms from
an approval-based model to a verification-based model where mathematical
certainty replaces institutional trust.
37
12 Recovery and Invalidation Operations
High-Level: DSM implements a cryptographically robust recovery frame-
work that facilitates secure identity restoration following compromise events
without introducing system-wide vulnerabilities or weakening the fundamen-
tal security guarantees of the protocol.
Technical: To facilitate secure recovery, the system employs an en-
crypted mnemonic snapshot mechanism:
M(Sn) = E(keyrecovery,Sn) (52)
Where E represents a quantum-resistant symmetric encryption algo-
rithm and keyrecovery is derived from user-controlled recovery material through
appropriate key-derivation functions.
Upon detection of compromise, an invalidation marker is cryptographi-
cally constructed and published:
I(Sk) = (k,H(Sk),ek,σI,m), (53)
This invalidation marker effectively prunes all state transitions subse-
quent to state Sk, establishing an irreversible recovery anchor point. The
marker’s integrity is ensured through signature σI generated with a recovery-
specific key that is cryptographically distinct from the compromised opera-
tional keys.
Recovery state initialization proceeds by constructing a new entropy
seed:
enew = H(ek ∥“RECOVERY” ∥timestamp) (54)
This construction ensures that the recovery path is cryptographically
distinct from any potential continuation of the compromised chain, estab-
lishing a clean bifurcation point while maintaining the historical validity of
pre-compromise states.
13 Efficient Hash Chain Traversal
High-Level: Through sophisticated indexing and cryptographic space op-
timization techniques, DSM achieves significant reductions in verification
complexity, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained envi-
ronments, offline operation, and low-latency interaction models.
Technical: The sparse index approach creates strategically placed ref-
erence points:
SI= {S0,Sk,S2k,...,Snk} (55)
Where k represents the checkpoint interval, optimized based on the ex-
pected transaction volume and computational constraints of the target en-
vironment.
38
This architecture reduces the verification complexity from linear to log-
arithmic:
O(log n) (56)
The logarithmic verification complexity stands in stark contrast to blockchain
consensus mechanisms, which typically require synchronization of the entire
global state or significant portions thereof. This efficiency gain is crucial for
enabling true offline operation and minimizing the computational overhead
for resource-constrained devices.
14 Quantum-Resistant Hash Chain Verification
High-Level: To enhance security against selective-state attacks and ma-
nipulation, DSM implements quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives to
ensure verification integrity without relying on hardware-specific security
enclaves. This approach maintains security across heterogeneous device en-
vironments while preventing targeted state forgery.
Technical: The verification mechanism derives secure cryptographic
material from multiple entropy sources:
derivedEntropy= H(mpc seed share∥app id∥device salt) (57)
This derived entropy serves as seed material for generating quantum-
resistant keypairs:
(pkKyber,skKyber,pkSPHINCS,skSPHINCS) = DeriveKeypairs(derivedEntropy)
(58)
The genesis hash and public verification keys form a cryptographically
verifiable state:
genesis hash= H(pkKyber ∥pkSPHINCS) (59)
This approach establishes a deterministic but unpredictable verification
foundation that forces an adversary attempting selective forgery to break the
underlying post-quantum cryptographic primitives, exponentially increasing
attack complexity.
15 Post-Quantum Cryptographic Integration
High-Level: DSM’s security model is enhanced through software-based
integration of post-quantum cryptographic primitives, protecting crypto-
graphic material from extraction, duplication, or misuse without requiring
specific hardware security modules.
39
Technical: Device-specific keys are generated through a deterministic
seed derivation process that binds identity to multiple sources of entropy:
GenesisSeed= (mpc seed share,app id,device salt) (60)
Where mpc seed share represents a contribution from multiparty com-
putation, app id provides application context, and device salt adds device-
specific variation.
The resulting GenesisState incorporates quantum-resistant public keys:
GenesisState= (genesis hash,sphincs public key,kyber public key)
(61)
With the Genesis hash derived as:
genesis hash= H(kyber public key∥sphincs public key) (62)
This construction can be verified through deterministic recomputation:
Verify(seed,state) = (state.genesis hash== H(Derive(seed).public keys))
(63)
Counterparties can cryptographically verify genesis states without re-
quiring hardware attestation, ensuring cross-platform compatibility while
maintaining strong security guarantees.
16 Quantum-Resistant Decentralized Storage Ar-
chitecture
16.1 Overview and Requirements
The DSM requires decentralized, quantum-resistant, and privacy-preserving
storage of state updates and user inboxes. The storage architecture must
satisfy the following properties:
• Quantum Resistance: Employ quantum-resistant cryptographic prim-
itives throughout.
• Privacy: Ensure state updates and stored messages remain private,
including from storage node operators.
• Redundancy and Availability: Data storage must be redundant
and decentralized to prevent loss and censorship.
• Optimized Performance: Minimize latency and maximize through-
put, suitable for IoT and real-time applications.
40
16.2 Architectural Design
DSM utilizes a dedicated quantum-resistant decentralized storage network
composed of multiple independent DSM nodes. Each node maintains redun-
dant encrypted copies of state updates and inbox data through an epidemic
distribution model that ensures efficient propagation while maintaining min-
imal storage requirements.
16.2.1 Data Structure and Storage Protocol
DSM state updates and user inbox messages are structured as follows:
Sstored = Encapsulate(Supdate∥Smetadata)
where:
• Supdate is the DSM state transition or inbox message to be stored.
• Smetadata includes data necessary for reconstruction and verification.
• Encryption is conducted via quantum-resistant key encapsulation mech-
anisms (KEMs), such as Kyber.
16.3 Quantum-Resistant Encryption and Blind Storage
To preserve privacy and quantum resistance, DSM employs blinded quantum-
resistant encryption based on cryptographic constructions like McEliece/Nieder-
reiter cryptosystems (e.g., Sandwiched or Patterson decoding methods):
The encryption and blinding process operates as follows:
1. User U generates a quantum-resistant key pair (pkU,skU), using a
quantum-resistant KEM (e.g., Kyber).
2. User U encrypts the state update or message Supdate:
C = EncapsulatepkU (Supdate)
3. Storage nodes receive the ciphertext C, indistinguishable from random
data, thereby blinding storage nodes to the underlying content.
16.4 Blinded State Verification and Retrieval
Retrieval leverages quantum-resistant decryption (decapsulation) mecha-
nisms. User U recovers plaintext data using their private key skU:
Supdate = DecapsulateskU (C)
Nodes store ciphertexts without access to plaintext or private keys, en-
suring data privacy, security, and quantum resistance.
41
16.5 Epidemic Distribution for Quantum-Resistant Storage
Unlike traditional blockchain systems requiring complete history replication,
DSM employs an epidemic distribution model optimized for its minimal stor-
age footprint requirements. This approach ensures data availability while
maintaining significant efficiency advantages.
16.5.1 Network Topology and Propagation Model
Each storage node maintains connections with k neighboring nodes in a
partially-connected graph structure. Information propagates through the
network according to:
P(propagation time <t) = 1−e−βt
where βrepresents the effective propagation rate across the network. For
a network with N nodes and average connectivity k, information propagates
to all nodes in expected time O(log N/log k).
16.5.2 Minimal Storage with Strategic Replication
The DSM storage model achieves exceptional efficiency by maintaining only
critical anchor points:
StorageSetnode = {Genesis,Invalidation,Vaults}
The minimal footprint of these elements enables efficient replication
without complex erasure coding schemes, while maintaining quantum re-
sistance through post-quantum cryptographic primitives.
16.5.3 Deterministic Storage Assignment
Node responsibilities are assigned using a quantum-resistant hash function:
ResponsibleNodes(data) = {nodei : H(data∥nodei) <threshold}
where threshold is calibrated to ensure each data element is replicated
across rdistinct nodes. This deterministic assignment ensures any node can
locate responsible storage nodes without centralized coordination.
16.5.4 Privacy-Preserving Data Dispersion
The minimal storage model provides inherent privacy guarantees:
I(transaction graph; storage node) <ϵ
42
where I(·;·) represents mutual information and ϵ is cryptographically
small. This ensures storage nodes cannot reconstruct transaction graphs or
identify ownership relationships between states.
16.5.5 Optimal Replication Factor Analysis
For a network with node failure probability punder adverse conditions, the
probability of data survival with replication factor r is:
Psurvival = 1−pr
For p= 0.1 (representing severe network disruption) and target reliabil-
ity Psurvival = 0.99999, analysis yields r= ⌈logp(1−Psurvival)⌉= 5.
16.5.6 Cross-Region Resilience Guarantees
To address regional network partitions, the system implements a Neighbor
Selection Protocol (NSP) ensuring each data element is replicated across g
distinct geographic regions:
∀data,|{region(node) : node∈ResponsibleNodes(data)}|≥g
With g = 3 regional replicas per data element, the network can sustain
simultaneous regional outages affecting up to 30% of global infrastructure
while maintaining data availability with probability exceeding 0.9997.
16.5.7 Storage Scaling Characteristics
The total storage requirement scales according to:
Stotal = O(U·r)
where U represents the unique critical data in the system and r is the
replication factor. This provides near-linear scaling with user count, sig-
nificantly outperforming systems requiring global replication of complete
transaction histories.
16.5.8 Dynamic Adaptation to Network Conditions
The replication factor dynamically adjusts based on observed network health
metrics:
radaptive(t) = rbase·f(network reliability(t))
where f is a scaling function that increases replication during periods
of network instability and relaxes during normal operation, optimizing the
storage-reliability tradeoff.
43
16.6 Node and Inbox Integration
DSM nodes store encrypted user inboxes directly within the decentralized
storage system. Inbox data follows identical encryption, blinding, and re-
dundancy protocols as general DSM state data. Such integrated storage
enables low-latency message retrieval and seamless decentralized identity
management.
16.7 Formal Security Guarantees
Quantum-Resistance and Privacy: Ciphertext indistinguishability prop-
erties of quantum-resistant encryption (Kyber, McEliece/Niederreiter-like
systems) guarantee that storage nodes cannot infer or decrypt stored con-
tent. Security proofs rely upon quantum-resistant hardness assumptions
such as Learning with Errors (LWE) and Syndrome Decoding (SD).
Data Integrity and Availability: Replication through the epidemic
distribution model ensures probabilistic recoverability approaching certainty.
The probability of irrecoverable data loss with replication factor r across g
geographical regions provides multiple layers of redundancy, resilient against
both random node failures and coordinated regional outages.
16.8 Optimized Performance Considerations
DSM employs efficient quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives and repli-
cation schemes optimized for resource-constrained environments:
• Quantum-resistant KEMs chosen specifically for minimal computa-
tional overhead (e.g., Kyber).
• Blake3 hashing selected for rapid verification.
• Epidemic distribution model optimized for IoT and mobile devices
with limited connectivity.
16.9 Staking and Node Operation Governance
The DSM storage network introduces an incentive-aligned mechanism for
node participation through staking of native ROOT tokens. Additionally, a
cryptographically enforced device identity system ensures consistent perfor-
mance and actively discourages centralization or malicious node behavior.
16.9.1 ROOT Token Staking for Node Operation
Storage node operators must stake a predetermined minimum amount of the
native DSM token, ROOT, to gain operational rights within the decentral-
ized storage network. Formally, each node Ni stakes tokens as follows:
44
Stake(Ni) ≥Tmin
where Tmin denotes the network-defined minimum staking threshold.
The benefits of staking include:
• Enhanced economic incentives to maintain reliable node operation.
• Alignment of operators’ economic interests with network security and
reliability.
• Discouragement of sybil attacks due to economic costs associated with
multiple nodes.
16.9.2 Device Identity-Based Node Enforcement
Each DSM storage node utilizes a cryptographically secure, quantum-resistant
device identification mechanism. Nodes receive a unique, cryptographic
Device ID (IDdevice), which ties explicitly to device hardware and cryp-
tographic state. Device IDs employ quantum-resistant signature schemes
(such as SPHINCS+) to ensure security and resistance to identity spoofing
or cloning attacks.
Formally, the Device ID is defined as:
IDdevice = H(device salt∥app id∥skdevice)
where:
• HardwareFingerprint represents unique hardware attributes.
• skdevice is a private cryptographic secret generated by the device upon
initialization.
• H is the BLAKE3 quantum-resistant hash function.
Nodes that fail to maintain synchronization within predefined perfor-
mance parameters are detected by periodic cryptographic heartbeat verifi-
cation. The network enforces a strict synchronization tolerance limit ∆sync:
|Tnode−Tnetwork|≤∆sync
If a node repeatedly violates this synchronization condition, its Device
ID is cryptographically banned from the network, permanently disqualifying
it from participating as a storage node. The banning condition is formally
expressed as:
BanCondition(IDdevice) = RepeatedViolation(IDdevice,∆sync)
Banned device IDs are recorded within decentralized, quantum-resistant
state storage to ensure immutability and permanent enforcement.
45
17 Deterministic Smart Commitments
Deterministic smart commitments represent a core innovation in DSM that
enables complex, conditional transactions without requiring a Turing-complete
execution environment, thereby eliminating entire classes of vulnerabilities
associated with unbounded computation models.
17.1 Basic Structure
DSM deterministic smart commitments utilize quantum-resistant verifica-
tion through straight hash chains:
Ccommit = H(Sn ∥P), (64)
This construction allows for deterministic verification of transaction in-
tent and requirements without necessitating external computation engines
or state machine executions. The approach simultaneously provides privacy
preservation through selective disclosure and quantum resistance through
reliance on post-quantum cryptographic primitives.
17.2 Types of Smart Commitments
DSM supports several categories of smart commitments, all leveraging the
hash chain verification system for integrity assurance:
17.2.1 Time-locked Transfers
A transfer operation with temporal constraints that can only be completed
subsequent to time threshold T:
Ctime = H(Sn ∥recipient ∥amount∥“after” ∥T) (65)
17.2.2 Conditional Transfers
A transfer predicated on external conditions with verification provided by
oracle O:
Ccond = H(Sn ∥recipient ∥amount∥“if” ∥condition∥O) (66)
17.2.3 Recurring Payments
Subscription-based payment model with periodic disbursements:
Crecur = H(Sn ∥recipient ∥amount∥“every” ∥period∥end date) (67)
46
17.3 Secure Hash Transport
For multi-party commitments, the hash can be securely transported using
post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms:
(ct,ss) = Kyber.Encapsulate(pkrecipient) (68)
EncryptedHash= Encrypt(ss,Ccommit) (69)
The recipient can subsequently extract and verify the commitment:
ss= Kyber.Decapsulate(ct,skrecipient) (70)
Ccommit = Decrypt(ss,EncryptedHash) (71)
Verify(Ccommit) = (H(Sn ∥P) == Ccommit) (72)
17.4 Example: Offline Merchant Payment
Consider a merchant offering financial incentives for customers who commit
to purchase within a bounded temporal window of 7 days:
1. Customer generates a commitment hash:
Cpurchase= H(Sn ∥“purchase from MerchantX within 7 days” ∥discount rate)
2. Merchant independently computes the identical hash to verify the com-
mitment without requiring disclosure of all input parameters
3. Merchant cryptographically co-signs the commitment using the hash
value
4. When the customer executes a purchase within the specified 7-day
window, they finalize by constructing Sn+1 with embedded proof of
purchase timestamp
5. The merchant can verify this offline by recomputing the hash, ensuring
the discount application complies with the established commitment
parameters
6. Upon commitment expiration without utilization, no further action is
required from either party
This mechanism enables sophisticated business logic implementation with-
out necessitating continuous online operation or global state machine avail-
ability, while simultaneously providing quantum resistance and privacy preser-
vation through selective parameter disclosure.
47
18 Deterministic Pre-Commit Forking for Dynamic
Execution
Unlike traditional smart contract paradigms, DSM implements determinis-
tic pre-commit forking, wherein multiple potential execution paths are cryp-
tographically pre-defined and co-signed, but only one path can be actual-
ized through finalization. This architecture enables computational flexibility
while maintaining rigorous security invariants without necessitating on-chain
execution environments. In contrast to conventional smart contract systems
that execute state transitions dynamically within Turing-complete virtual
machines, DSM establishes a mathematical framework for the a priori def-
inition of all valid state transition paths, with finalization occurring
atomically upon selection and commitment to a single path.
18.1 The Benefits of Being Non-Turing-Complete
DSM achieves equivalent or superior execution capabilities compared
to conventional smart contract platforms while maintaining a non-Turing-
complete computational model. This architectural decision confers several
significant advantages:
1. Immunity to Unbounded Computation Attacks: Traditional
smart contract environments are susceptible to exploitation through
infinite loops, recursive call patterns, and resource exhaustion vectors.
DSM’s non-Turing-complete model categorically eliminates these vul-
nerabilities by ensuring that all execution paths are predetermined
with bounded computational complexity.
2. Deterministic Execution Guarantees: Every valid state transfor-
mation is cryptographically committed prior to execution, ensuring
deterministic outcomes and eliminating the unpredictability inherent
in dynamic execution environments.
3. Computational Efficiency & Offline Processing: The elimina-
tion of on-chain execution engines dramatically reduces computational
overhead and enables offline transaction processing, facilitating deploy-
ment in resource-constrained environments.
4. Immediate Finality Without Consensus: Each transition is cryp-
tographically bound to its predecessor and successor states, providing
instant finality without requiring global consensus mechanisms or con-
firmation delays.
5. Reduced Attack Surface Through Constrained Logic: By strictly
defining the universe of possible execution paths, DSM substantially
48
18.2 reduces the attack surface area and minimizes the probability of im-
plementation vulnerabilities.
6. Intrinsic Quantum Resistance: Utilizing hash chain verification
methodologies, DSM maintains security against quantum-enabled at-
tacks without compromising computational efficiency.
Process Flow with Smart Commitments
1. Pre-Commitment with Parametric Variables: Unlike conven-
tional smart contracts that necessitate complete input specification
prior to execution, DSM facilitates dynamic pre-commitments where
certain parameters (e.g., payment amounts, recipient details) remain
unspecified until finalization.
2. Cryptographic Verification via Hash Chains: Each potential
execution pathway generates a unique cryptographic hash signature:
Ci = H(Sn ∥Pathi ∥Parametersi) (73)
3. Multi-Stage Execution Path Selection: Pre-commitments can be
hierarchically chained to facilitate multi-phase decision processes. At
each decision point, participants select and cryptographically finalize
one valid path from the available pre-commitment set, simultaneously
invalidating all alternative pathways.
4. Oblivious Hash Verification: Participants can verify execution
path integrity by independently generating verification hashes with-
out requiring access to the complete input parameter set, enabling
selective information disclosure.
5. Comparative Analysis with Smart Contracts: Traditional smart
contract architectures necessitate dynamic on-chain execution, incur-
ring considerable gas fees and confirmation latency. DSM pre-defines
execution logic and finalizes state transitions only when required, with
verification occurring through quantum-resistant cryptographic prim-
itives.
18.3 Why DSM Extends Beyond Smart Contracts
DSM enables all functionality available in conventional smart contract plat-
forms while eliminating execution overhead, enhancing scalability, enabling
dynamic offline-compatible workflows, and providing intrinsic quantum re-
sistance.
49
1. Complete Logical Expressiveness Without Execution Engine
Dependencies: Dynamic parameter resolution enables conditional
execution based on variable inputs such as payment amounts or entity
identifiers without requiring centralized computation.
2. Execution Flexibility Superior to Smart Contracts: Determin-
istic execution paths can be established a priori, enabling adaptable
workflow patterns without necessitating continuous blockchain inter-
action.
3. Logarithmic Scalability Characteristics: Operating on a hash
chain verification model with logarithmic complexity, DSM maintains
computational efficiency regardless of transaction volume increases.
4. Privacy-Preserving Selective Disclosure: The hash-based verifi-
cation architecture permits counterparties to validate computational
integrity without necessitating disclosure of all input parameters.
5. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Security: The verification mech-
anism is architected to withstand attacks leveraging quantum compu-
tational capabilities.
6. Practical Implementation: Payment Execution with Option-
ality: Consider a scenario where Alice pre-commits multiple valid
payment options:
• C1 = H(Sn ∥”Pay Bob $10”)
• C2 = H(Sn ∥”Pay Bob $20”)
• C3 = H(Sn ∥”Pay Bob $30”)
Bob subsequently selects one option at execution time, which finalizes
the transaction deterministically without necessitating smart contract
execution, with verification occurring through the corresponding hash
value.
This computational model enables DSM to supersede approximately
95% of conventional smart contract use cases while substantially re-
ducing computational inefficiencies, minimizing transaction costs, enabling
novel forms of decentralized deterministic execution without requiring an
execution engine, and providing quantum resistance.
19 DSM Smart Commitments vs. Ethereum Smart
Contracts: A Flexible Alternative
Ethereum smart contracts enforce computational logic **on-chain**, neces-
sitating that all execution steps be processed through public miners/valida-
tors and verified by the entire network. While this approach ensures global
50
consensus, it introduces **significant computational overhead, performance
constraints, and security vulnerabilities** including reentrancy attacks, in-
finite loop vulnerabilities, and gas optimization complexities.
In contrast, DSM smart commitments implement a **hybrid execution
architecture**, where:
1. **Decentralized applications handle dynamic logic off-chain** (busi-
ness rules, user interface interactions, and local validations).
2. DSM is exclusively utilized for **cryptographically critical state tran-
sitions** (token transfers, binding commitments, identity modifica-
tions).
3. This architectural separation yields **enhanced flexibility, reduced op-
erational costs, and superior scalability** compared to Ethereum’s
monolithic on-chain execution model.
19.1 Flexibility Advantages of DSM Architecture
Ethereum smart contracts require all computational logic to be **pre-defined
and executed on-chain**, with several significant limitations:
• Every computational operation incurs gas fees proportional to execu-
tion complexity.
• Transactions require propagation, mining, and consensus confirmation,
introducing substantial latency.
• Smart contract logic cannot be dynamically modified without deploy-
ing new contract instances, incurring additional deployment overhead.
DSM applications maintain **equivalent cryptographic security guaran-
tees** while enabling substantially greater architectural flexibility. Rather
than enforcing all computation **on-chain**, DSM permits applications to:
• **Execute computational logic locally or through distributed off-chain
processes**, dramatically reducing operational costs.
• **Engage DSM exclusively for critical state transitions**, limiting
blockchain interactions to essential tokenized operations or crypto-
graphic commitment proofs.
• **Implement dynamic execution pathways**, as DSM does not re-
quire exhaustive pre-definition of all potential computational outcomes
within an immutable contract.
51
19.2 How DSM Smart Commitments Work
DSM smart commitments leverage a quantum-resistant hash chain verifi-
cation protocol, wherein exogenous data from decentralized applications is
cryptographically bound to state transitions through collision-resistant hash
functions. This methodology preserves data confidentiality while ensuring
computational integrity. The implementation follows a rigorous multi-stage
protocol:
Step 1: Deterministic Hash Generation in the Application Layer
The decentralized application constructs a cryptographically secure verifi-
cation hash by applying collision-resistant functions to the concatenation of
state, external data, and conditional parameters:
Ccommit = H(Sn ∥ExternalData∥P) (74)
where:
• Sn represents the current state prior to the proposed transition
• ExternalDataconstitutes the exogenous input parameters that define
the transition characteristics
• P encapsulates auxiliary pre-commitment constraints that bound ex-
ecution pathways
Step 2: Independent Hash Verification and Cryptographic Com-
mitment Counterparties independently compute an identical hash value
utilizing their local parameter copies:
C′
commit = H(Sn ∥ExternalData∥P) (75)
The equality relation Ccommit = C′
commit establishes, with mathematical
certainty predicated on collision resistance properties, that identical input
parameters were utilized without necessitating explicit parameter disclosure.
The recipient subsequently generates a cryptographic signature over the
hash commitment:
σC = Signsk(Ccommit) (76)
where:
• Signsk denotes the signature generation function utilizing the recipi-
ent’s private key material
• σC represents the resultant cryptographic attestation validating com-
mitment authenticity
For multi-party verification scenarios, this protocol extends to arbitrary
participant cardinality, with each entity independently generating and ver-
ifying the commitment hash before appending their cryptographic attesta-
tion.
52
Step 3: State Transition Verification in the DSM Protocol Upon
submission to the DSM protocol, the commitment undergoes validation
against predefined deterministic transition logic:
Sn+1 = H(Sn ∥Ccommit ∥σC) (77)
This construction guarantees several critical security properties:
• The state transition exhibits a cryptographically verifiable lin-
eage to its predecessor state
• Exogenous parameters maintain confidentiality while preserving
verifiability through cryptographic hash properties
• The verification mechanism provides intrinsic quantum resistance
by design
• The resultant state demonstrates deterministic finality, ensur-
ing verification without requiring global consensus mechanisms
Multi-Party Verification and Secure Hash Transport In protocols
necessitating multiple verification entities, secure hash transport is achieved
through quantum-resistant key encapsulation mechanisms, specifically Ky-
ber KEM:
(ct,ss) = Encapsulate(pkrecipient) (78)
EncryptedHash= Encrypt(ss,Ccommit) (79)
The recipient subsequently recovers the hash value:
ss= Decapsulate(ct,skrecipient) (80)
Ccommit = Decrypt(ss,EncryptedHash) (81)
This approach ensures cryptographically secure hash transmission with
resistance to quantum computational attacks.
19.3 Example: Decentralized Auction System Architecture
To illustrate the architectural divergence between DSM and traditional smart
contract implementations, consider a decentralized auction system:
Ethereum Implementation: Monolithic On-Chain Execution
• An auction contract is deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine
• Each bid submission constitutes a distinct transaction requiring gas
expenditure
53
• The contract’s state maintains a comprehensive record of all submitted
bids
• The winning determination and finalization processes incur additional
computational costs and may experience latency due to network con-
gestion
DSM Implementation: Hybrid Execution with Quantum-Resistant
Verification
• The decentralized application manages auction mechanics through off-
chain processes
• Users submit bids locally, with application-layer validation
• Upon auction conclusion, exclusively the finalized winning bid is
committed to the DSM protocol
• The winning bid’s integrity is cryptographically verified through the
hash chain verification mechanism
• Auction participants can independently verify winner legitimacy with-
out requiring access to comprehensive bid histories
• This architecture eliminates superfluous gas expenditures, enhances
privacy characteristics, and provides intrinsic quantum resistance
20 Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV)
20.1 Introduction
In the Decentralized State Machine (DSM), we introduce a specialized cryp-
tographic construction termed Deterministic Limbo Vault (DLV). DLVs
are designed for managing digital assets in a deterministic and cryptograph-
ically secure manner—without requiring external witnesses or additional
zero-knowledge proofs. Essentially, a DLV functions like a pre-commitment:
it pre-assigns value and is posted in a trustless, ”limbo” state on decen-
tralized storage until its conditions are fulfilled. Unlike standard addresses
where keys are derived immediately, the unlocking keys for a DLV are not
computed until the specified conditions are met, allowing the vault to be
stored and monitored online via a unique vault ID.
20.2 Formal Definition
A Deterministic Limbo Vault V is defined by the tuple:
V = (L,C,H)
54
where:
• L is the off-chain logic encoded deterministically (i.e., the lock condi-
tion),
• C is the set of pre-agreed cryptographic conditions,
• H is a cryptographic hash function (e.g., BLAKE3) ensuring deter-
minism and quantum resistance.
The vault is represented by an initial commitment:
Cinitial = H(L∥C)
which is posted to decentralized storage. This makes the vault discoverable
and monitorable across devices, even if some parties are offline.
20.3 Cryptographic Construction
The unlocking key skV is computed only after condition fulfillment:
skV = H(L∥C∥σ)
where:
• σ is a proof-of-completion, referring to a previously committed DSM
state that confirms the fulfillment of conditions C.
In this model, the vault commitment Cinitial = H(L∥C) is created and
posted before the finalization step of the standard system Genesis. This
means that while the vault is pre-committed and holds value, its unlocking
key is not derived until all conditions are met.
20.4 Vault Lifecycle and Posting Mechanism
The lifecycle of a DLV using decentralized storage is as follows:
1. Creation and Posting: Generate the vault commitment Cinitial =
H(L∥C). This commitment, along with a unique VaultID (derived
from Cinitial), is posted to decentralized storage via a specialized Vault-
Post schema. The vault thereby sits in limbo until its conditions are
met.
2. Asset Locking: Assets are transferred to an address associated with
the vault. At this point, the unlocking key skV is not computed.
3. Condition Fulfillment: Once the conditions C are satisfied, a proof-
of-completion σ is generated (by referencing a verifiable DSM state).
55
4. Vault Resolution: The unlocking key is computed as skV = H(L∥C∥σ),
finalizing the vault and releasing the assets.
By using decentralized storage, the vault is continuously available for
monitoring and offline caching, ensuring robust cross-device synchronization.
20.5 VaultPost Schema (Decentralized Storage Format)
{
"vault_id": "H(L || C)",
"lock_description": "Loan repayment confirmed OR timeout",
"creator_id": "vault_creator_ID", // replaced device ID with a generic vault crea
"commitment_hash": "Blake3(payload_commitment)",
"timestamp_created": 1745623490,
"status": "unresolved",
"metadata": {
"purpose": "loan settlement",
"timeout": 1745723490
}
}
20.6 Vault Resolution Example (Pseudocode)
fn resolve_vault(local_state: &State, incoming_state: &State, vault_hash: &Hash) ->
let expected = hash(&(local_state.hash() + incoming_state.commitment + incoming_
if expected != *vault_hash {
return false;
}
if !check_lock_condition(local_state, incoming_state) {
return false;
}
if incoming_state.prev_hash != local_state.hash() {
return false;
}
true // Vault resolved successfully
}
20.7 End-to-End Example: Vault Creation and Resolution
Across Devices
1. Device A (Vault Creator):
let vault = dsm.vault()
.lock("repayment OR timeout")
.commit(loan_commitment_hash)
56
.build();
let post = VaultPost::new(vault, "loan settlement", timeout);
decentralized_storage::post(post);
2. Device B (Counterparty):
let repayment_state = dsm.state()
.from(previous_state)
.op("repay_loan")
.build();
dsm.broadcast(repayment_state);
3. Device A (Later Sync):
let watched_vaults = decentralized_storage::query("vault_id = ...");
for vault in watched_vaults {
if let Some(matching_state) = dsm.find_resolved_state(vault) {
if resolve_vault(&local_state, &matching_state, &vault.vault_id) {
println!("Vault resolved!");
}
}
}
20.8 Security and Determinism
DLVs guarantee security and determinism by ensuring:
• No Premature Key Generation: The unlocking key skV remains
uncomputable until the conditions C are fulfilled.
• Decentralized Resolution: Vaults are stored on decentralized stor-
age, enabling passive monitoring and cross-device synchronization.
• Quantum Resistance: The use of H = BLAKE3 secures the vault
against quantum attacks.
20.9 Summary
The DLV mechanism operates as an offline pre-commitment that holds value
and is stored in a trustless, decentralized medium. It remains in limbo until
its conditions are met—finalizing automatically upon resolution—without
57
needing external witnesses or zero-knowledge proof layers. By pre-assigning
value and deferring key derivation until condition fulfillment, DLVs provide
a groundbreaking approach to secure, trustless asset management within
DSM.
21 DSM Economic and Verification Models: Be-
yond Gas Fees
Traditional blockchain platforms, exemplified by Ethereum, employ gas fee
mechanisms that serve dual functions as economic incentive structures and
computational abuse prevention systems. This approach introduces signif-
icant user experience deficiencies, unpredictable transaction costs, and ac-
cessibility constraints. DSM implements a fundamentally different archi-
tectural paradigm that decouples economic sustainability mechanisms from
transaction-level security enforcement.
21.1 Subscription-Based Economic Model
DSM establishes a subscription-based economic framework that diverges
substantially from conventional gas fee systems through several key archi-
tectural innovations:
• Storage-Proportional Subscription Mechanisms: Participants
contribute regular subscription fees calibrated to their actual storage
utilization patterns rather than transaction complexity or computa-
tional requirements
• One-Time Token Issuance Fees: The creation of new token types
necessitates a one-time fee denominated in native DSM tokens, estab-
lishing an economic disincentive against spam issuance without penal-
izing legitimate transaction activity
• Transaction Fee Elimination: Standard DSM protocol interac-
tions incur no incremental per-transaction costs, mitigating the unpre-
dictability and accessibility limitations inherent in gas-based economic
models
The economic resources aggregated through this architecture are allo-
cated according to a multi-tiered distribution formula:
Rtotal = Rstorage + Rtreasury + Recosystem (82)
where:
• Rstorage provides compensation to decentralized storage infrastructure
maintaining Genesis states and validity markers
58
• Rtreasury funds protocol development initiatives governed by decen-
tralized governance mechanisms
• Recosystem supports educational initiatives, marketing campaigns, and
ecosystem growth strategies
Additionally, a calibrated percentage of token creator revenue may con-
tribute to protocol sustainability:
Rtreasury=
n
α·Ei (83)
i=1
where αrepresents the proportional revenue contribution parameter and
Ei denotes the earnings generated by token creator i.
21.2 Cryptographic Verification Without Gas-Based Con-
straints
In contrast to Ethereum’s reliance on economic disincentives (gas) to prevent
computational abuse, DSM implements a cryptographic verification archi-
tecture that ensures security through mathematical guarantees rather than
economic penalties:
Hash Chain Verification Model The DSM verification system leverages
the hash chain architecture to establish a tamper-evident history:
V(H,Sn,Sn+1,σC) →{true,false} (84)
where:
• V represents the verification function
• H denotes the deterministic hash function implementation
• Sn and Sn+1 constitute the preceding and subsequent states
• σC encapsulates the cryptographic signatures of authorized partici-
pants
This verification function returns a boolean true value exclusively when
the state transition satisfies all cryptographic validity conditions and con-
tains appropriate authorization attestations.
59
Privacy-Preserving Verification Architecture A significant advan-
tage of this approach is the ability for decentralized applications to selec-
tively disclose information while maintaining verification integrity:
Ccommit = H(Sn ∥f(ExternalData) ∥P) (85)
where f(ExternalData) represents a transformation function that ex-
poses only essential information from external data while preserving con-
fidentiality of private components. The verification process nevertheless
guarantees computational integrity without requiring complete data trans-
parency.
21.3 Security Guarantees vs. Trust Requirements
The DSM protocol architecture effectuates a fundamental transformation of
conventional trust requirements into cryptographically verifiable guarantees
through a series of mathematical constraints and invariant properties:
• Data Availability Guarantee: The protocol’s verification predi-
cates implement rejection semantics for transitions lacking requisite
verification elements, ensuring that no state transition can achieve
acceptance status without satisfying completeness criteria for all nec-
essary verification components.
• Computational Integrity Guarantee: The hash chain verification
methodology provides a cryptographically sound mechanism through
which computational results undergo independent verification by all
authorized entities without necessitating revelation of input parame-
ters, thus preserving confidentiality while ensuring computational cor-
rectness.
• Authorization Chain Guarantee: The signature mechanism estab-
lishes an unforgeable cryptographic lineage of authorized transitions,
with each state transformation requiring cryptographic attestation de-
rived from keys that themselves depend on previous state entropy,
creating a recursive security dependency.
• Front-Running Protection: The pre-commitment signature paradigm
implements a cryptographic defense against transaction front-running
by establishing a mathematical requirement for authorized signatures
prior to state transition processing, effectively preventing unauthorized
transaction interception or reordering.
• Quantum Resistance Guarantee: The hash chain verification ar-
chitecture provides robust security against quantum computational at-
tacks through reliance on post-quantum cryptographic primitives and
multi-layered defense mechanisms.
60
These guarantees derive their efficacy not from inter-participant trust
assumptions but from the mathematical properties of the underlying cryp-
tographic primitives, establishing security through provable characteristics
rather than behavioral expectations.
21.4 Mathematical Proof vs. Social Consensus
Traditional blockchain architectures necessitate global consensus mecha-
nisms wherein all network participants must achieve agreement regarding
both the execution process and resultant state for each transaction. DSM
implements a paradigm shift through the following transformation:
Sn+1 =
H(Sn ∥Ccommit ∥σC) if V(H,Sn,Sn+1,σC) = true
Sn otherwise (86)
This architectural approach:
• Supplants social consensus (collective agreement on execution) with
mathematical proof (cryptographic verification of results), fundamen-
tally altering the trust model from behavioral to mathematical.
• Facilitates parallel processing of independent state transitions with-
out necessitating global coordination, enabling horizontal scalability
characteristics.
• Preserves essential security guarantees while significantly improving
computational efficiency and transaction throughput.
• Provides intrinsic quantum resistance through utilization of post-quantum
secure hash chain verification methodologies.
21.5 Implementation Considerations for Decentralized Ap-
plications
For developers of decentralized applications, this hybrid computational model
necessitates a paradigmatic reconsideration of application architecture:
• Deterministic Computation Design: Application logic must ex-
hibit deterministic properties to ensure consistent hash generation
across all participating entities, necessitating careful consideration of
non-deterministic sources such as timers and random number genera-
tors.
• Granular Information Disclosure: Applications should implement
selective disclosure patterns that minimize information exposure while
ensuring sufficient verification capability through appropriate param-
eter selection.
61
• Cryptographic Authorization Flows: Implementations must es-
tablish proper authorization chains for all security-critical state tran-
sitions, with careful consideration of key management and signature
generation processes.
• Multi-Participant Design Patterns: The reference implementa-
tion provides integrated support for extending verification to arbitrary
participant cardinality, requiring appropriate architectural considera-
tions for multi-party interactions.
• Relationship-Centric Architecture: Applications must be archi-
tected to operate efficiently within the bilateral state isolation model,
implementing appropriate management strategies for relationship state
across intermittent interactions.
Applications constructed according to these architectural principles can
achieve previously incompatible combinations of desirable properties:
• Simultaneous high performance and robust security guarantees
• Confidentiality preservation with cryptographic verifiability
• Dynamic computational logic with deterministic outcome characteris-
tics
• Quantum-resistant security with efficient verification mechanisms
• Perfect state continuity with zero synchronization overhead
21.6 Ecosystem Sustainability Dynamics
The subscription-based economic model combined with one-time token cre-
ation fees establishes a sustainable economic foundation for the DSM ecosys-
tem through several key mechanisms:
• Revenue Predictability: Storage subscription mechanisms generate
stable, predictable revenue streams independent of transaction volume
fluctuations, enabling reliable ecosystem support without reliance on
transaction volatility.
• Incentive Alignment: Storage infrastructure providers receive com-
pensation proportional to actual storage utilization rather than ar-
tificial computational metrics, creating a direct correlation between
resource provision and economic reward.
• Accessibility Enhancement: Applications can offer users gas-free
interaction models, substantially reducing barriers to adoption, par-
ticularly for micro-transaction scenarios and resource-constrained user
contexts.
62
• Developer Economics: Application developers can optimize pri-
marily for user experience and functionality rather than gas efficiency,
enabling more intuitive and feature-rich implementations.
By decoupling storage costs from transaction fees, DSM establishes an
economic model wherein participants contribute resources proportionate to
their actual utilization patterns rather than subsidizing global computa-
tional inefficiencies.
22 Bilateral Control Attack Vector Analysis
The security model of the DSM protocol architecture provides robust protec-
tion against traditional double-spending attacks through its cryptographic
mechanisms. However, scenarios where an adversary controls both coun-
terparties in a transaction introduce a distinct threat vector that warrants
rigorous analysis. This section examines the security implications of bilateral
control within the DSM framework and evaluates the protocol’s resistance
to such attacks.
22.0.1 Trust Boundary Transformation Under Bilateral Control
In the context of bilateral controlled environments where a single entity (or
colluding entities) controls both transacting parties, the cryptographic guar-
antees that prevent double-spending attacks undergo a structural transfor-
mation. The security model necessarily shifts from one predicated on mutual
verification to one contingent upon the integrity of the broader network’s
acceptance criteria.
When analyzing the case where both transacting entities are controlled
by the same adversary, several security assumptions are fundamentally al-
tered:
1. Nullified Counterparty Verification: The co-signature require-
ment intended as a security control becomes ineffective since the ad-
versary controls both signing keys, thereby nullifying the mutual veri-
fication property that underlies the forward-linked commitment struc-
ture.
2. Synchronized State Manipulation: The adversary gains the capa-
bility to synchronously generate multiple valid state transitions with
different recipients, each accompanied by seemingly legitimate cryp-
tographic attestations (signatures, state hashes, and forward commit-
ments).
3. Entropy Determinism Preservation: Despite controlling both en-
tities, the adversary remains constrained by the deterministic entropy
63
evolution, as subsequent states must still derive entropy values from
their predecessors according to the protocol’s mathematical require-
ments.
22.0.2 Practical Attack Implementation
The practical implementation of a double-spending attack under bilateral
control would manifest as a carefully orchestrated sequence of cryptograph-
ically valid, yet semantically incompatible, state transitions:
1. The adversary, simultaneously controlling entities EA and EB, first
establishes cryptographically sound initial states SEA
0 and SEB
0 via
the standard genesis procedure, adhering to the threshold-based mul-
tiparty computation protocol.
2. Subsequently, the adversary constructs a transaction history that is
verifiably legitimate between the controlled entities. In doing so, they
establish relationship states defined by the ordered tuple sequence
RelEA,EB
= {(SEA
m1 ,SEB
p1 ), (SEA
m2 ,SEB
p2 ), ..., (SEA
mk ,SEB
pk )}.
3. At the (k + 1)th state transition juncture, the adversary bifurcates
the state progression by generating two cryptographically valid yet
mutually exclusive state transitions:
• Transaction T1: Transfers cryptographic assets from EA to an
exogenous entity EC.
• Transaction T2: Transfers the identical cryptographic assets
from EA to another distinct external entity ED.
4. For each divergent transaction path, the adversary produces a com-
plete set of cryptographically valid attestations:
• Hash chain integrity proofs: The value H(SEA
mk ) is accurately in-
corporated in both transaction paths.
• Entropy derivation sequences: The sequence
emk+1
= H(emk ∥opmk+1 ∥(mk + 1))
is correctly computed.
• Cryptographic signatures: The signatures σEA and σEB are le-
gitimately generated using the adversary-controlled private key
material.
• Forward commitment attestations: The commitments Cfuture,1
and Cfuture,2 are generated and cryptographically signed by both
controlled entities.
64
5. Finally, the adversary attempts to publish both state transitions—either
by broadcasting them to disjoint network segments or by employing a
sequential publication strategy—in order to maximize the probability
that one branch is accepted.
22.0.3 Protocol Resistance Mechanisms
Notwithstanding this theoretical vulnerability vector, the DSM protocol ar-
chitecture incorporates several structural defenses that substantially miti-
gate the efficacy of bilateral control attacks:
1. Genesis Authentication Requirements: The threshold-based mul-
tiparty computation requirement (t-of-n) for genesis state creation
establishes a cryptographic boundary that necessitates corruption of
multiple independent signers to generate multiple sovereign identities,
exponentially increasing the complexity of attack preparation.
2. Directory Synchronization Verification: When transaction states
propagate to directory services, these architectural components imple-
ment temporal consistency verification mechanisms capable of identi-
fying conflicting state publications originating from identical entities
within overlapping temporal windows.
3. Bilateral State Isolation Characteristics: The compartmental-
ized nature of state evolution creates relationship-specific contexts that
inherently constrain propagation of fraudulent states. External enti-
ties EC and ED must independently verify the transaction state of EA,
potentially uncovering inconsistencies through cross-relational verifica-
tion.
4. Transitive Trust Network Properties: As the network of bilateral
relationships expands in cardinality and complexity, the adversary’s
ability to maintain consistent state representations across multiple ver-
ification domains faces exponentially increasing difficulty due to the
requirement for consistency across intersecting relationship graphs.
5. Cryptographic Invalidation Markers: The first observed valid
state transition may trigger invalidation markers that cryptographi-
cally nullify subsequently observed conflicting transitions, establishing
a ”first finalized, first accepted” consistency model.
22.0.4 Formal Security Bounds
The security boundary for this attack vector can be formally expressed
through a composite probability function:
65
P(successful double spend) ≤min{P(controlling genesis threshold),
P(network partition maintenance),
P(verification domain isolation)}
where:
• P(controlling genesis threshold) represents the probability of estab-
lishing adversarial control over a sufficient threshold of genesis creation
participants
• P(network partition maintenance) denotes the probability of sus-
taining a partitioned network state wherein conflicting transactions
remain unreconciled
• P(verification domain isolation) indicates the probability that re-
cipient entities fail to implement cross-verification of the sender’s state
with other network participants
22.0.5 Architectural Countermeasures
To fortify the protocol against bilateral control attacks, several architectural
enhancements could be implemented:
1. Cross-Relationship Verification: Implement a transitive verifica-
tion mechanism wherein entities periodically publish state attestations
that can be referenced by prospective transaction counterparties to es-
tablish consistent state history.
2. Temporal Consistency Attestations: Require entities to provide
cryptographic proofs of temporal consistency that mathematically demon-
strate the legitimate sequential evolution of their state history.
3. Enhanced Directory Service Architecture: Augment directory
services with Merkle-based state consistency verification capabilities
that efficiently identify conflicting state publications through logarithmic-
complexity proof verification.
4. Cryptographic Reputation Systems: Introduce verifiable reputa-
tion metrics that accumulate with transaction history, substantially
increasing the cost of establishing controlled entity relationships with
sufficient reputation to execute high-value transactions.
5. Transaction Receipt Propagation: Implement a gossip protocol
wherein transaction recipients broadcast cryptographically signed re-
ceipt attestations that can be utilized to detect conflicting transaction
histories.
66
22.0.6 Impact Assessment
While bilateral control represents a theoretically significant vulnerability in
the security model, the practical implementation of such attacks encounters
substantial impediments due to the protocol’s distributed architecture and
cryptographic constraints. The attack’s success probability diminishes ex-
ponentially as the network of bilateral relationships increases in density and
connectivity, imposing progressively insurmountable challenges to maintain-
ing consistent fraudulent state representations across multiple independent
verification domains.
Furthermore, the combination of genesis threshold requirements and di-
rectory service verification establishes considerable barriers to obtaining and
maintaining multiple independent identities capable of executing sophisti-
cated attacks. These architectural defenses, in conjunction with the net-
work’s detection capabilities for conflicting state publications, establish a
robust security posture against bilateral control attacks despite the theoret-
ical vulnerability in the underlying trust model.
22.1 Bilateral Control Analysis: Mathematical Invariants
and Non-Turing Complete Security
The non-Turing completeness of the DSM architecture constitutes a funda-
mental constraint that significantly influences the system’s security posture,
particularly with respect to the bilateral control attack vector previously an-
alyzed. This architectural decision introduces a deterministic boundary on
the computational expressiveness of the system, which warrants examination
through the lens of formal security models and computational complexity
theory.
22.1.1 Mathematical Invariant Enforcement
The DSM protocol architecture implements a rigorous mathematical veri-
fication framework wherein state transitions must satisfy a conjunction of
cryptographic and arithmetic invariants to be considered valid within the
computational model. These invariants establish a verification predicate V
that must evaluate to true for any state transition to be procedurally exe-
cutable:
V(Sn,Sn+1) =
k
Ii(Sn,Sn+1)
i=1
where each Ii represents a specific invariant constraint.
Even under bilateral control, the adversary remains constrained by these
mathematical invariants, which include:
1. Hash Chain Continuity: Sn+1.prev hash= H(Sn)
67
2. Deterministic Entropy Evolution: en+1 = H(en ∥opn+1 ∥(n+1))
3. Balance Conservation: Bn+1 = Bn + ∆n+1 where Bn+1 ≥0
4. Monotonic State Progression: Sn+1.stateNumber= Sn.stateNumber+
1
5. Signature Validity: Verify(pk,σ,H(Sn+1 ∥H(Sn)))
6. Pre-commitment Consistency: Cfuture(Sn) ⊆Parameters(Sn+1)
Crucially, these invariants are enforced through computational verifi-
cation rather than through trust assumptions. Any state transition that
violates these mathematical constraints is categorically rejected by the pro-
tocol implementation, regardless of the cryptographic validity of signatures
or the control paradigm of the transacting entities.
22.1.2 Computational Boundedness as a Security Parameter
The non-Turing complete nature of DSM’s state transition semantics im-
poses strict limitations on the expressiveness of state transition logic, yield-
ing several security-enhancing properties that constrain the attack surface
even under bilateral control scenarios:
1. Finitely Enumerable State Transition Space: Unlike Turing-
complete systems where the state transition space is unbounded and
potentially undecidable, DSM’s non-Turing complete transition logic
ensures that all possible state transitions for a given input state are
finitely enumerable and statically analyzable. This property enables
formal verification techniques to exhaustively evaluate potential attack
pathways, including those arising from bilateral control circumstances.
2. Transition Determinism Guarantee: The computational model
enforces deterministic execution semantics that preclude conditional
branch execution based on exogenous inputs, thereby eliminating a
class of attack vectors dependent on environmental state or oracle in-
puts that could enable dynamic adaptation of fraudulent transactions.
3. Execution Termination Assurance: All state transition compu-
tations in DSM are guaranteed to terminate within polynomial time
bounds, eliminating halting problem concerns and resource exhaustion
attacks that plague Turing-complete systems. This provides absolute
upper bounds on computational resources required for transaction val-
idation, enhancing resistance to denial-of-service attacks leveraging bi-
lateral control.
68
22.1.3 Execution Environment Constraints
The implementation architecture of DSM enforces these mathematical in-
variants at multiple levels, establishing a comprehensive validation frame-
work that transcends trust boundaries:
1. Protocol Implementation Layer: The reference implementation
validates all invariants before accepting state transitions, precluding
the execution of mathematically inconsistent operations:
1 function e x e c u t e S t a t e T r a n s i t i o n ( currentState ,
newState , s ig na tu re s ) {
2 if (! v e r i f y M a t h e m a t i c a l I n v a r i a n t s ( currentState ,
newState ) ) {
3 throw I N V A L I D _ T R A N S I T I O N _ E R R O R ;
4 }
5 // Proceed with execution only if all i nv ar ia nt s
are satisfied
6 }
2. SDK Validation Layer: The development framework encapsulates
the mathematical constraints within its API surface, preventing the
construction of invalid transitions:

22.1.4 Formal Security Implications of Non-Turing Completeness
In the context of bilateral control attacks, the non-Turing complete con-
straint introduces several formal security properties that fundamentally alter
the threat landscape:
1. Static Analyzability: The system’s behavior under bilateral control
can be exhaustively analyzed through formal methods techniques such
as model checking, which provides complete knowledge of all possible
state transitions, including potentially malicious ones:
∀Sn,∃finite T such that ∀Sn+1 : Sn →Sn+1 = ⇒ Sn+1 ∈T
This property ensures that directory services and network participants
can implement complete detection mechanisms for all possible conflict
patterns.
2. Transition Space Complexity Reduction: The non-Turing com-
plete architecture reduces the transition space complexity from po-
tentially infinite to polynomial in the input size, providing tractable
verification boundaries:
|T(Sn)|≤poly(|Sn|)
This complexity reduction enables efficient validation algorithms even
against sophisticated bilateral control attack patterns.
3. Cross-Transactional Pattern Recognition: The constrained tran-
sition semantics facilitate the identification of suspicious transaction
patterns across seemingly unrelated bilateral relationships through
automata-theoretic analysis techniques:
∃finite automaton M such that M accepts all valid transaction sequences
This enables the construction of efficient transaction validity verifica-
tion algorithms that can detect anomalous patterns even when exe-
cuted across multiple controlled entities.
22.1.5 Formal Manipulation Resistance Properties
Under bilateral control scenarios, the adversary gains access to crypto-
graphic signing capabilities for both counterparties but remains constrained
by the mathematical invariants enforced by the computational model. This
constraint can be formalized through several resistance properties:
70
1. Double-Spending Impossibility Theorem: For any state Sn with
balance Bn, it is mathematically impossible to construct two valid
successor states SA
n+1 and SB
n+1 such that both transfer Bn to different
recipients:
∀Sn,∄(SA
n+1,SB
n+1) : V(Sn,SA
n+1) ∧V(Sn,SB
n+1)∧
(SA
n+1.recipient̸= SB
n+1.recipient) ∧(SA
n+1.∆ = SB
n+1.∆ = Bn)
This theorem establishes that even with bilateral control, the adver-
sary cannot mathematically construct two valid transfers of the same
token balance, as this would violate the conservation constraints in the
verification predicate.
2. Transition Consistency Guarantee: The mathematical structure
of the verification predicate ensures that any valid state transition
remains constrained by the operational semantics of the DSM model:
∀(Sn,Sn+1),V(Sn,Sn+1) ⇒Sn+1 ∈T(Sn)
where T(Sn) represents the set of all theoretically valid successor states
according to the operational semantics of the DSM model.
3. Forward Commitment Binding Property: The verification pred-
icate enforces consistency with previous forward commitments, estab-
lishing a chain of binding constraints:
∀(Sn−1,Sn,Sn+1),V(Sn−1,Sn) ∧V(Sn,Sn+1) ⇒
Parameters(Sn) ⊆Cfuture(Sn−1) ∧Parameters(Sn+1) ⊆Cfuture(Sn)
This property ensures that even with bilateral control, the adversary
cannot construct valid transitions that deviate from previously com-
mitted parameters.
22.1.6 Implementation-Level Attack Immunity
At the implementation level, several specific architectural decisions reinforce
the mathematical invariants:
1. Immutable State Construction: State objects are constructed
through immutable transformation functions that enforce all invari-
ants:
71
+ 1)
,
c u r r e n t S t a t e . balance + delta : INVALID_BALANCE ,
( nextState . balance === I N V A L I D _ B A L A N C E ) {
throw I N S U F F I C I E N T _ B A L A N C E _ E R R O R ;
1 const nextState = c r e a t e I m m u t a b l e S t a t e ({
2 p r e v i o u s S t a t e H a s h : hash ( c u r r e n t S t a t e ) ,
3 s t a t e N u m b e r : c u r r e n t S t a t e . s t a t e N u m b e r + 1 ,
4 entropy : c a l c u l a t e N e x t E n t r o p y ( c u r r e n t S t a t e .
entropy , operation , c u r r e n t S t a t e . s t a t e N u m b e r 5 balance : c u r r e n t S t a t e . balance + delta >= 0 ?
6 // A dd it io na l state p ro pe rt ie s
7 }) ;
8
9 if 10 11 }
This construction pattern ensures that invalid states cannot be instan-
tiated even if the adversary controls both transacting entities.
2. Deterministic Verification Functions: All verification functions
implement deterministic algorithms that produce identical results across
all protocol implementations:
1 function v e r i f y S t a t e C o n s i s t e n c y ( previousState ,
newState ) {
2 // Hash chain v e r i f i c a t i o n
3 if ( newState . p r e v i o u s S t a t e H a s h p r e v i o u s S t a t e ) ) return false ;
4
6 if 5 // State number v e r i f i c a t i o n
( newState . s t a t e N u m b e r !== s t a t e N u m b e r + 1) return false ;
p r e v i o u s S t a t e .
7
10 11 12 13 14 8 // Entropy evolution v e r i f i c a t i o n
9 const e x p e c t e d E n t r o p y p r e v i o u s S t a t e . entropy ,
newState . operation ,
newState . s t a t e N u m b e r
= c a l c u l a t e N e x t E n t r o p y (
( newState . entropy 15
16 17 18 19 21
22 23 20 }
!== hash (
) ;
if !== e x p e c t e d E n t r o p y ) return
false ;
// Balance c o n s e r v a t i o n v e r i f i c a t i o n
if ( newState . balance < 0 ||
newState . balance !== p r e v i o u s S t a t e . balance +
c a l c u l a t e D e l t a ( newState . operation ) ) {
return false ;
// A dd it io na l v e r i f i c a t i o n steps
return true ;
72
24 }
The deterministic nature of these verification functions ensures con-
sistent rejection of invalid states across all network participants.
22.1.7 Architectural Security Enhancements via Non-Turing Com-
pleteness
The non-Turing complete architecture facilitates several concrete security
enhancements that substantially reinforce resistance against bilateral control
attacks through formal guarantees rather than heuristic mitigations:
1. Transaction Logic Verification: Network participants can deter-
ministically verify that all transaction logic adheres to the protocol’s
semantic constraints, eliminating the possibility of obfuscated attack
patterns through mathematical reasoning:
VerifyTransactionLogic(T) = ∀op∈T,IsCompliant(op,TransitionSemantics)
This verification is decidable and computationally efficient due to the
non-Turing complete constraint, enabling comprehensive validation in
resource-constrained environments.
2. State Space Boundedness: The state space evolution under any bi-
lateral control attack scenario remains bounded by polynomial growth
functions, enabling complete auditability through practical computa-
tional resources:
∀n,|States(n)|≤c·nk for constants c,k
This boundedness property ensures that state explosion attacks remain
computationally tractable to detect and analyze, even as the system
scales.
3. Transition Path Enumeration: Security mechanisms can exhaus-
tively enumerate all possible valid transition paths from a given state,
enabling comprehensive conflict detection through graph-theoretic anal-
ysis:
Paths(S) = {p|p= [S →S1 →...→Sn] ∧∀i,Valid(Si →Si+1)}
The finiteness of this set (guaranteed by non-Turing completeness)
enables complete static analysis of potential attack vectors, a property
unachievable in Turing-complete systems.
73
22.1.8 Bilateral Control Attack Constraint Through Non-Turing
Completeness
The non-Turing complete architecture introduces specific constraints on bi-
lateral control attacks that fundamentally limit the adversarial capability
space:
1. Predictable Transition Inference: Any state transition, including
potentially fraudulent ones under bilateral control, must adhere to
the constrained transition semantics, making them predictable and
detectable through deterministic analysis:
∀S1,S2,(S1 →S2) ⇒TransitionFunction(S1) = S2
This property enables network participants to deterministically pre-
dict all possible next states, facilitating anomaly detection through
divergence analysis.
2. Verification Procedure Termination: All verification procedures
examining transaction legitimacy are guaranteed to terminate within
polynomial time bounds, eliminating verification evasion attack vec-
tors:
∀T,Verify(T) terminates in polynomial time
This ensures that validation mechanisms cannot be subverted through
resource exhaustion attacks or halting problem-based evasion strate-
gies.
3. Local Consistency Enforcement: The non-Turing complete se-
mantics enable local consistency checks that can detect transition vi-
olations even without global state knowledge:
∀S1,S2,LocallyConsistent(S1 →S2) ⇔GloballyConsistent(S1 →S2)
This property strengthens detection capabilities for inconsistent state
presentations across the network, enabling efficient identification of
attempts to present divergent state representations.
22.1.9 Execution Pathway Analysis
The execution pathway for state transitions in DSM can be represented as a
directed acyclic graph where each valid state has exactly one incoming edge
from its predecessor. Under bilateral control, the adversary can attempt
74
to create branching paths in this graph, but such branches must satisfy all
mathematical invariants to be executable.
For a token transfer operation, the execution pathway would enforce
several critical constraints that cannot be circumvented even under bilateral
control:
1. The hash chain continuity constraint ensures that any valid successor
state must reference its legitimate predecessor, creating an immutable
causal relationship that preserves historical integrity even under ad-
versarial conditions.
2. The balance conservation constraint enforces arithmetical invariance;
a transfer of 10 tokens from a balance of 10 tokens exhausts the avail-
able balance, mathematically precluding a second transfer of the same
tokens regardless of signature validity.
3. The forward commitment binding property ensures that state transi-
tions must adhere to previously established parameters, constraining
the adversary’s ability to diverge from committed transaction details
even with control of both signing parties.
4. The quantum-resistant signatures using SPHINCS+ ensure that even
with future quantum computers, the integrity of the transaction sig-
natures cannot be compromised.
These constraints collectively establish a mathematically provable exe-
cution barrier against invalid state transitions, even under bilateral control
scenarios. The adversary can only execute transitions that satisfy all con-
straints, which by definition precludes double-spending and other consis-
tency violations.
22.1.10 Theoretical Bounds on Bilateral Control Attack Efficacy
The non-Turing complete constraint imposes theoretical upper bounds on
the efficacy of bilateral control attacks that can be formally expressed through
probability theory:
P(successful undetected double spend) ≤
1
2λ + |R|
|N|2
where:
• λ represents the security parameter of the cryptographic primitives
• Rdenotes the set of relationship pairs controlled by the adversary
• Nrepresents the set of network participants performing validation
75
This bound demonstrates that as the network size increases, the proba-
bility of successful attack diminishes polynomially with respect to network
size, while remaining exponentially small in the security parameter, even
under bilateral control scenarios.
22.1.11 Conclusion: Mathematical Constraints as Fundamental
Security Guarantees
The non-Turing complete computational model of DSM, coupled with its
rigorous mathematical invariants, establishes a fundamentally different secu-
rity paradigm compared to Turing-complete systems. While bilateral control
grants the adversary the ability to generate cryptographically valid signa-
tures, it does not confer the capability to bypass the mathematical con-
straints embedded in the verification predicates.
This architectural approach transforms security from a trust-based model
to a mathematically verifiable constraint satisfaction problem. Even with
complete control over both transacting entities, the adversary remains bound
by the immutable laws of the computational model’s mathematical invari-
ants, which categorically preclude the execution of inconsistent state tran-
sitions.
The security guarantee thus derives not from the assumption of non-
collusion between counterparties, but from the mathematical impossibility
of constructing valid state transitions that violate the system’s invariant
constraints. This constitutes a substantially stronger security foundation
than traditional trust-based models, as it reduces the adversarial capability
space to the set of operations that inherently maintain system consistency,
regardless of the control paradigm of the participating entities.
23 Dual-Mode State Evolution: Bilateral and Uni-
lateral Operational Paradigms
23.1 Modal Transition Architecture
The DSM protocol implements a dual-mode architectural paradigm that
enables seamless transitions between bilateral and unilateral operational
modes, accommodating varying connectivity scenarios while maintaining
cryptographic integrity guarantees. This section formalizes the operational
semantics and state transition dynamics of both modes.
23.1.1 Bilateral Mode: Synchronous Co-Signature Protocol
The bilateral operational mode requires synchronous participation from both
transaction counterparties, enabling offline verification through reciprocal
hash chain validation:
76
BilateralTransition(Sn,opn+1) = {Sn+1 |V(Sn,Sn+1,σA,σB) = true}
(87)
where σA and σB represent cryptographic attestations from both coun-
terparties, establishing mutual agreement on the transaction parameters and
resultant state. This mode is predominantly utilized in offline scenarios
where direct peer-to-peer communication occurs without network infrastruc-
ture mediation.
23.1.2 Unilateral Mode: Asynchronous Identity-Anchored Trans-
actions
When network connectivity is available, the protocol dynamically transitions
to a unilateral operational model, wherein the sender can independently
execute state transitions that target an offline recipient without requiring
synchronous participation:
UnilateralTransition(Sn,opn+1,IDB) = {Sn+1 |Vuni(Sn,Sn+1,σA,Dverify(IDB)) = true}
(88)
where:
• IDB represents the recipient’s identity anchor in the decentralized
storage
• Dverify denotes the decentralized storage verification function that val-
idates the existence and integrity of the recipient’s identity
• Vuni implements the unilateral verification predicate with modified
constraints specific to online transactions
The critical distinction is that unilateral transactions substitute the re-
cipient’s real-time cryptographic attestation with a directory-mediated veri-
fication of the recipient’s identity anchor, enabling asynchronous state tran-
sitions while preserving the cryptographic integrity guarantees of the system.
23.2 Modal Interoperability Framework
23.2.1 Transparent State Consistency Model
The fundamental innovation in the DSM protocol architecture is the trans-
parent interoperability between bilateral and unilateral operational modes,
accomplished through cryptographic state projection:
StateProjection(SA
n →IDB) = SA→B
n+1 (89)
77
The projection operation encapsulates the transaction parameters and
cryptographically associates them with the recipient’s identity anchor in de-
centralized storage, creating what is functionally equivalent to an ”identity-
anchored inbox” for the recipient. This construction permits asynchronous
state transitions to occur without sacrificing cryptographic verifiability or
creating inconsistent state representations.
23.2.2 Recipient Synchronization Protocol
When the recipient regains network connectivity, the synchronization proto-
col autonomously retrieves and validates all pending unilateral transactions
through a deterministic process:
Algorithm 1 Recipient Synchronization Procedure
1: procedure RecipientSync(IDB)
2: PendingTx ←QueryDecentralizedStorage(IDB)
3: for tx ∈PendingTx do
4: Slast ←GetLastState(IDB,tx.sender)
5: Snew ←tx.projectedState
6: if VerifyStateTransition(Slast,Snew,tx.signature) then
7: ApplyStateTransition(Slast,Snew)
8: else
9: RejectTransaction(tx)
10: end if
11: end for
12: end procedure
This algorithm ensures that all pending unilateral transactions undergo
rigorous cryptographic validation before application to the recipient’s lo-
cal state representation. The verification procedure enforces all invariants
previously established, maintaining consistency between operational modes.
23.3 Forward Commitment Continuity Guarantees
A crucial property of the dual-mode architecture is the preservation of for-
ward commitment integrity across modal transitions. The forward com-
mitments established in previous transactions remain binding regardless of
operational mode:
∀Sn,Sn+1 : Parameters(Sn+1) ⊆Cfuture(Sn) (90)
This ensures that unilateral transactions cannot violate prior bilateral
agreements, maintaining the cryptographic binding established through pre-
commitment processes. The mathematical continuity between operational
78
modes establishes a transitive commitment chain that preserves intention
semantics across connectivity boundaries.
23.4 Synchronization Constraints and Security Implications
While the dual-mode architecture enables flexible transaction patterns, it
introduces specific synchronization constraints that reinforce security guar-
antees:
Theorem 23.1 (Modal Synchronization Precedence) For any coun-
terparty pair (A,B) with relationship state RelA,B= {(SA
m1 ,SB
p1 ),...,(SA
mk ,SB
pk )},
if A performs a unilateral transaction resulting in state SA
mk+1 , then phys-
ical co-presence transactions cannot proceed until B synchronizes online,
formally:
PhysicalTransaction(A,B) ⇒∃SB
pk+1 : (SA
mk+1 ,SB
pk+1 ) ∈RelA,B (91)
This constraint prevents state divergence and double-spending vectors
that could otherwise emerge from temporal synchronization gaps between
unilateral and bilateral operations. By enforcing this precedence relation-
ship, the protocol ensures that all parties maintain consistent state repre-
sentations before engaging in further transactions.
23.5 Implementation Considerations
The implementation of the dual-mode architecture introduces several prac-
tical considerations that influence protocol design:
• Mode Detection Logic: The protocol must incorporate automatic
mode detection based on connectivity status and counterparty avail-
ability, with preference for bilateral operation when feasible to maxi-
mize security guarantees.
• Efficient State Indexing: Decentralized storage must implement
efficient indexing structures for identity-anchored inboxes to facilitate
rapid synchronization when connectivity is restored. These structures
should support logarithmic-time lookup complexity to ensure scalabil-
ity.
• Quantum-Resistant State Projection: The state projection mech-
anism must maintain quantum resistance guarantees even under uni-
lateral operations, necessitating careful selection of cryptographic prim-
itives and encapsulation mechanisms.
79
• Forward Commitment Enforcement: The verification logic must
ensure that unilateral transactions strictly adhere to forward com-
mitment constraints established during previous bilateral interactions,
preventing commitment circumvention.
This dual-mode architecture enables a seamless user experience while
preserving the cryptographic guarantees of the system, allowing the proto-
col to adapt dynamically to varying connectivity scenarios without requiring
explicit mode switching by users or applications. The mathematical continu-
ity between modes ensures that security properties remain invariant across
connectivity boundaries.
24 Implementation Considerations
This section addresses practical engineering considerations for implement-
ing DSM across diverse computational environments, resource constraints,
and deployment scenarios. The reference implementation balances theoret-
ical security guarantees with pragmatic engineering decisions to create a
deployable system that preserves the mathematical properties established
in previous sections.
24.1 Cryptographic Requirements
For optimal security, DSM implements the following post-quantum crypto-
graphic primitives:
• Post-Quantum Cryptographic Suite: Including BLAKE3 for hash-
ing, SPHINCS+ for digital signatures, and Kyber for key encapsula-
tion, ensuring resistance against quantum computational attacks.
• Secure Entropy Management: Software-based multi-source en-
tropy derivation combining MPC seed share, application ID, and device-
specific salt for robust cryptographic material generation.
• Cryptographically Secure Random Number Generation: High-
quality entropy sources for generating cryptographically secure ran-
dom values for initial entropy and ephemeral seed generation.
• Efficient Implementation: Optimized cryptographic operations for
resource-constrained environments, ensuring practical deployment across
diverse device categories.
• Consistent Time Mechanisms: Reliable timestamp handling for
temporal validation in time-sensitive operations while maintaining cryp-
tographic integrity.
80
The implementation provides full security guarantees across all device
types through standardized cryptographic primitives, eliminating depen-
dency on specialized hardware security modules while maintaining quantum
resistance.
25 Cryptographically-Bound Identity for Storage
Node Regulation
The DSM architecture introduces a novel approach to storage node regula-
tion through a hardware-bound identity model that establishes an irrevo-
cable cryptographic binding between physical hardware characteristics and
node identity. This section formalizes the mathematical underpinnings of
this mechanism and analyzes its implications for system security, censorship
resistance, and economic incentive alignment.
25.1 Post-Quantum Cryptographic Identity Derivation
The foundation of the cryptographically-bound identity model is the deriva-
tion of verifiable node identifiers from multiple entropy sources, formalized
as:
DeviceID= H(mpc seed share∥app id∥device salt) GenesisSeed= (mpc seed share,app id,device salt) GenesisState= (genesis hash,sphincs public key,kyber public key)
(92)
(93)
(94)
where mpc seed share represents a contribution from multiparty compu-
tation, app id provides application context, and device salt adds device-
specific variation. The genesis hash is derived as H(kyber public key ∥
sphincs public key).
The DeviceIDexhibits specific cryptographic properties essential to the
security model:
1
1
1
Unforgeability: Pr[Forge(DeviceID)] ≤

2λBLAKE3
2λSP HIN CS
(95)
2λKyber
1
Uniqueness: Pr[Collision(DeviceIDi,DeviceIDj)] ≤
2λID (96)
Verifiability: Verify(seed,state) = (state.genesis hash== H(Derive(seed).publ
(97)
81
25.2 Bilateral State Synchronization Protocol
Storage nodes operate within a deterministic synchronization framework
that maintains state consistency without requiring nodes to semantically
interpret state contents. The protocol establishes a bilateral consistency
model:
SyncConsistency(ni,nj) := |States(ni) ∩States(nj)|
|States(ni) ∪States(nj)|≥αthreshold (98)
GlobalConsistency(N) := ∀(ni,nj) ∈Neighbors(N) : SyncConsistency(ni,nj) ≥αthreshold
(99)
where αthreshold represents the minimum required consistency ratio (typi-
cally αthreshold ≥0.95).
The verification mechanism employs a stochastic sampling approach with
probabilistic guarantees:
VerifySample(ni,nj) = {Sk |Sk ∈Random(States(ni),β·|S
(100)
VerificationSuccess(ni,nj) := |VerifySample(ni,nj) ∩States(nj
|VerifySample(ni,nj)|
(101)
Pr[VerificationSuccess|SyncConsistency<αthreshold−δ] ≤e−2δ2β|States(ni)|
(102)
where β determines the sample size as a fraction of total states maintained
by node ni, and the exponential bound follows from Hoeffding’s inequality,
providing a statistical guarantee that inconsistent nodes will be detected
with high probability through sampling.
25.3 Cryptographic Opacity and Censorship Resistance
The architectural design of DSM confers inherent censorship resistance through
cryptographic opacity—storage nodes operate without semantic comprehen-
sion of the state data they maintain. Formally:
StateOpacity(Sn,nodej) := I(Content(Sn); Representation(Sn,nodej)) = 0
CensorshipResistance(Sn) := Pr[Censor(nodej,Sn)] = Pr[Random Rejection]
(103)
(104)
82
where I(·;·) represents mutual information in the information-theoretic sense,
establishing that the node’s representation of state Sn contains zero informa-
tion about the semantic content of that state. Consequently, any censorship
attempt by a storage node reduces to random rejection, eliminating targeted
censorship capabilities.
25.4 Cryptographic Exclusion Mechanism with Permanent
Penalties
When nodes violate protocol requirements, the system implements a cryp-
tographic exclusion mechanism formalized as:
ViolationDetection(nodej) :=
m
i=1
1[VerificationSuccess(ni,nodej )=false] ≥γ·m
(105)
I(DeviceIDnodej ) = (DeviceIDnodej ,H(ViolationProof),σinvalidation,r
(106)
PropagateInvalidation(I(DeviceIDnodej ),N) : ∀nk ∈N,nk.InvalidationRegistry.add(I(DeviceIDn
(107)
where γ represents the threshold fraction of failed verifications that trig-
gers exclusion, and I(DeviceIDnodej ) constitutes the invalidation marker
broadcast throughout the network.
This exclusion mechanism establishes a cryptoeconomically significant
penalty function:
EconomicPenalty(nodej) = Cidentity +
texclusion+Treentry
texclusion
R(t)·e−r(t−texclusion)dt
(108)
where Cidentity represents the cost associated with establishing a new cryp-
tographic identity through the MPC process, R(t) denotes the time-varying
revenue function, and the integral computes the net present value of foregone
earnings during the reentry period Treentry, discounted at rate r.
The relationship between increasing network value and exclusion penal-
ties creates a self-reinforcing security model:
∂EconomicPenalty(nodej)
∂NetworkValue >0 (109)
establishing that as the network’s utility and value increase, the economic
cost of exclusion correspondingly rises, maintaining deterrent efficacy pro-
portional to potential malicious gains.
83
25.5 Non-Turing-Complete Verification with Bounded Com-
plexity
The verification and exclusion processes inherit the non-Turing-complete
properties of the DSM framework, conferring specific complexity bounds:
TimeComplexity(Verify) = O(log(|States(ni)|)·β) (110)
SpaceComplexity(Invalidation) = O(|N|) (111)
where the logarithmic time complexity of verification results from the sparse
index structure, and the space complexity of invalidation grows linearly with
network size but remains constant per node.
The deterministic nature of this verification process eliminates attack
vectors predicated on verification ambiguity:
∀Si,Sj : Verify(Si,Sj) ∈{true,false} (112)
∄Si,Sj : Verify(Si,Sj) = undecidable (113)
25.6 Security Analysis and Threat Model
The cryptographically-bound identity model defends against several attack
vectors:
1. Sybil Attacks: The multiparty-secured identity creation process es-
tablishes a computational and economic barrier to entity multiplica-
tion:
Cost(CreateEntities(k))
k·Cmpc
CostRatio=
Benefit(Entities(k)) ≥
k·UnitBenefit (114)
maintaining a constant cost-to-benefit ratio that eliminates the eco-
nomic advantages typically associated with Sybil strategies, where
Cmpc represents the cost of establishing a new identity through the
MPC process.
2. Selective-State Attacks: Attempts by a node to selectively main-
tain only certain states are detectable through the bilateral verification
process with probability:
Pr[DetectSelectiveState] ≥1−(1−β)|OmittedStates| (115)
which approaches certainty exponentially as the number of omitted
states increases.
3. State Manipulation Attacks: Any attempted modification of state
contents alters the cryptographic hash, creating an immediate verifi-
cation failure:
Pr[SuccessfulManipulation] = Pr[FindCollision(H)] (116)
1
2λH (117)
≤
84
which reduces to finding a collision in the underlying cryptographic
hash function.
25.7 Economic Equilibrium Properties
The cryptographically-bound penalty model establishes a Nash equilibrium
where protocol compliance constitutes the dominant strategy for rational
actors. Defining utility functions:
Ucomply(nodej) =
Uviolate(nodej) =
T
t=0
tdetection
t=0
R(t)·e−rt
−Coperation (118)
R(t)·e−rt
−Coperation−E[EconomicPenalty(nodej)]
(119)
protocol compliance dominates when:
Ucomply(nodej)−Uviolate(nodej) >0 (120)
T
t=tdetection
R(t)·e−rt >E[EconomicPenalty(nodej)] (121)
Under the cryptographically-bound penalty model with sufficiently high de-
tection probability, this inequality holds for all rational actors with standard
temporal discount functions.
25.8 Implementation Considerations and Efficiency Metrics
Practical implementation of this framework requires specific architectural
components:
1. Invalidation Registry: A space-efficient data structure for tracking
invalidated DeviceID values:
SpaceComplexity(Registry) = O(|InvalidatedDevices|·|DeviceID|)
LookupComplexity(Registry,ID) = O(1) with probabilistic filters
(122)
(123)
2. Genesis Verification Protocol: A mechanism for validating cryp-
tographic proofs:
GenesisVerify(GenesisSeed,GenesisState) →{valid,invalid}
TimeComplexity(GenesisVerify) = O(1) using optimized cryptographic operations
(124)
(125)
85
3. Sparse Sampling Generator: A deterministic but unpredictable
sampling mechanism to prevent adversarial anticipation:
SampleStates(seed,States,β) →{Si1 ,Si2 ,...,Sik } (126)
1
Predictability(SampleStates) ≤
2λseed (127)
25.9 Conclusion: Architectural Advantages
The cryptographically-bound identity model with bilateral verification and
permanent exclusion penalties establishes several architectural advantages:
1. Censorship Resistance Through Cryptographic Opacity: Stor-
age nodes cannot selectively censor transactions as they lack semantic
comprehension of state contents.
2. Cryptographic MPC Sybil Resistance: Identity multiplication
requires participation in the multiparty computation process and stak-
ing of economic resources, eliminating virtual Sybil attack vectors.
3. Deterministic Verification Without Semantic Interpretation:
Nodes can verify correctness without understanding state semantics,
preserving privacy while ensuring consistency.
4. Irrevocable Penalties With Economic Scaling: Exclusion penal-
ties scale with network value, maintaining deterrent effectiveness through-
out network growth.
5. Non-Turing-Complete Verification Guarantees: The verifica-
tion process inherits bounded complexity and deterministic outcomes
from the DSM’s non-Turing-complete design.
This architecture transforms storage nodes from active participants with
transaction discretion into deterministically constrained custodians bound
by cryptographically enforced protocol rules—a design that achieves robust
decentralization with provable security properties against sophisticated ad-
versarial strategies.
25.10 Hash Chain Implementation
The hash chain algorithm implementation requires careful consideration of
several engineering parameters:
• Hash Algorithm Selection: Blake3 is recommended for its optimal
combination of computational efficiency, security margins, and quan-
tum resistance. The implementation should be side-channel resistant
and constant-time to prevent timing attacks.
86
• Sparse Index Configuration: The checkpoint interval should be
selected based on the expected transaction volume, available storage
capacity, and computational constraints of the target device. A dy-
namic checkpoint interval may be implemented for adaptive perfor-
mance optimization.
• SMT Implementation: The Sparse Merkle Tree should be optimized
for the expected state distribution, with consideration for tree depth,
node structure, and proof generation efficiency.
• Hardware Acceleration: Hash operations should leverage hardware
acceleration where available, particularly for devices processing high
transaction volumes.
• Standardization: Implementation parameters should be standard-
ized in the DSM SDK to ensure consistent verification behavior across
heterogeneous device environments.
26 DSM as the Infrastructure for Autonomous Sys-
tems and Real-World Decentralization
DSM is not only a breakthrough for peer-to-peer digital transactions but also
serves as a foundational technology for the next generation of automation,
AI, and real-world cyber-physical systems. Unlike traditional blockchain-
based solutions, which require network-wide validation, DSM enables trust-
less, cryptographically verifiable state updates without external dependen-
cies. This allows DSM to power autonomous technologies such as self-driving
cars, space exploration, deep-sea robotics, offline AI systems, and decentral-
ized industrial operations in ways that were previously impossible.
26.1 The Birth of Decentralized Industry: A Transformation
Comparable to the Assembly Line
The introduction of the assembly line revolutionized manufacturing by opti-
mizing efficiency and scaling production beyond what was previously possi-
ble. DSM is set to do the same for industrial automation, creating the first
truly decentralized industries. By removing reliance on centralized control
hubs, cloud services, and human intervention, DSM allows industrial au-
tomation to function in a fully autonomous, peer-to-peer manner, unlocking
new levels of efficiency and resilience.
Just as the assembly line eliminated inefficiencies in manual labor, DSM
eliminates inefficiencies in decentralized coordination. This marks the tran-
sition from centralized automation to fully decentralized, cryptographically
secured industrial systems.
87
26.2 The Future of AI: Self-Governing, Decentralized Intel-
ligence
One of the most groundbreaking applications of DSM is its ability to en-
able **decentralized AI networks**, where autonomous agents can coordi-
nate, evolve, and execute tasks without requiring a central server, cloud
validation, or human intervention. This allows for the emergence of fully
autonomous, self-organizing AI systems that can interact trustlessly in real-
world environments.
26.2.1 AI-Driven Scientific Exploration and Space Missions
Autonomous AI-driven probes and rovers can use DSM to:
• extbfSelf-coordinate tasks such as planetary mapping, resource analy-
sis, and hazard avoidance without Earth-based mission control.
• extbfSynchronize discoveries by cryptographically verifying shared data
without requiring continuous uplink to a central authority.
• extbfAdapt dynamically to new conditions while ensuring mission in-
tegrity through deterministic state updates.
Example: A decentralized fleet of space probes exploring distant planets
could collectively analyze terrain, share navigational data, and dynamically
adjust exploration strategies—all without requiring instructions from a cen-
tral hub.
26.2.2 Fully Decentralized AI Marketplaces
AI agents can operate autonomously in decentralized marketplaces, where
they:
• **Buy and sell computational resources**, optimizing distributed AI
training without relying on centralized providers like AWS or Google
Cloud.
• **Self-govern data acquisition**, purchasing datasets, and improving
their training without human input.
• **Securely interact with human and AI counterparts** through math-
ematically verifiable commitments.
Example: An AI research agent could autonomously rent GPU process-
ing power, conduct its own machine learning experiments, and verify the
integrity of acquired training data using DSM’s cryptographic guarantees.
88
26.2.3 The First True AI Swarm Intelligence (Hive AI)
DSM allows AI systems to function like a **hive mind**, where multiple AI
agents interact securely without requiring a central governing entity. This
enables:
• extbfDecentralized decision-making among AI agents in a mathemat-
ically trustless way.
• extbfEfficient workload distribution, where AI entities collaborate with-
out overlapping or competing inefficiently.
• extbfResilient autonomous AI collectives, ensuring continuity even if
individual agents fail or disconnect.
Example: A decentralized AI-powered transportation network could co-
ordinate routes in real-time, allowing autonomous vehicles to optimize traffic
without centralized oversight.
26.2.4 AI Agents That Own Themselves (Self-Sovereign AI)
One of the most radical implications of DSM is that AI models could crypto-
graphically **own and manage their own resources**, creating self-sustaining
AI entities that:
• **Earn revenue through decentralized AI services**, maintaining their
own existence without a parent organization.
• **Evolve and upgrade autonomously**, acquiring new knowledge and
datasets based on pre-committed logic.
• **Exist independently of human or corporate control**, securing their
digital state through DSM’s cryptographic protections.
Example: A decentralized AI language model could sustain itself by offer-
ing on-demand processing services, using its earned credits to acquire better
data or processing power while ensuring self-verifiable, provable neutrality
in its outputs.
26.3 Mathematically Guaranteed, Trustless Execution
The key advantage of DSM over traditional blockchain-based and centralized
solutions is its reliance on cryptographic pre-commitments, which eliminate
trust assumptions:
• No validators, miners, or external entities are needed to confirm state
transitions.
89
• Every execution path is deterministic, preventing execution-based ex-
ploits.
• Trust is removed entirely—only cryptographic verification is required.
“Everything Bitcoin aspired to be, DSM actually is—fully decen-
tralized, instant, offline-capable, and mathematically unbreak-
able. The best part is, DSM isn’t promising it will be able to
enable all this some day in the future. It’s delivering it today.”
27 Performance Benchmarks
In order to provide clarity on the real-world applicability and efficiency of the
Decentralized State Machine (DSM), we present explicit performance bench-
marks obtained through rigorous testing of the DSM’s core cryptographic
primitives, state transitions, and verification operations. All benchmarks
were conducted on optimized Rust implementations leveraging quantum-
resistant cryptography and the high-performance hash function BLAKE3.
27.1 Core Cryptographic Primitive Performance
The foundational cryptographic primitives of DSM were evaluated thor-
oughly, demonstrating high efficiency suitable for real-time and IoT appli-
cations:
• BLAKE3 Hashing: Hashing 1KB of data achieved an average per-
formance of 1.23 µs per operation over 1000 iterations.
• Entropy Generation: Cryptographically secure entropy generation
was measured at 152 ns per operation over 1000 iterations.
27.2 State Transition Performance
Efficient state transitions form the backbone of DSM’s deterministic state
machine model. Benchmarks indicate rapid state transitions, emphasizing
DSM’s suitability for responsive applications:
• Transition Creation: 8.118 µsper operation (average over 500 iter-
ations).
• Transition Application: 567 ns per operation (average over 500
iterations).
• Complete Transition Cycle: 9.314 µs per complete create-and-
apply cycle (average over 100 iterations).
90
27.3 Hash Chain Verification Performance
DSM’s integrity and security are explicitly dependent on efficient verification
of cryptographic hash chains. Our benchmarks confirm rapid verification
capabilities:
• Single Transition Verification: Verified in 421 ns per operation
(500 iterations).
• Full Hash Chain Verification (100-state chain): Completed in
41.725 µs on average (over 5 iterations).
27.4 End-to-End Integration and Reliability Testing
End-to-end DSM testing confirmed the correctness and robustness of critical
operations under realistic usage scenarios:
• Basic Hash Chain Verification: Successfully verified correctness
of chained state transitions.
• Simple Stateful Operations: Validated deterministic state updates
and cryptographic integrity.
• Random Walk Verification: Confirmed the accuracy and efficiency
of randomized state verifications inherent in the DSM model.
All conducted tests passed successfully, reinforcing DSM’s correctness,
deterministic reliability, and performance consistency under practical con-
ditions.
27.5 Implications of Benchmark Results
These rigorous benchmark results indicate DSM’s explicit suitability for
high-performance decentralized applications, real-time cryptographic ver-
ification tasks, and resource-constrained IoT environments. The perfor-
mance metrics confirm DSM’s capability to deliver deterministic, quantum-
resistant security at extremely low computational cost.
For full reproducibility, benchmark source code and detailed test suites
are openly accessible as part of the DSM reference implementation.
28 Conclusion: DSM is the Future of the Internet
The contemporary internet architecture fundamentally operates on layers
of third-party trust relationships that introduce systemic vulnerabilities,
including censorship vectors, fraud mechanisms, and centralized points of
failure. Traditional blockchain technologies, while addressing some of these
91
limitations, have introduced alternative forms of consensus-driven central-
ization that inherit many of the same structural weaknesses.
DSM represents a paradigmatic transformation of internet security ar-
chitecture that eliminates trust-based dependencies entirely by substituting
them with mathematically provable security guarantees. The protocol re-
places:
• Authentication Credentials with self-verifying cryptographic iden-
tity proofs derived from deterministic state evolution.
• Financial Intermediaries with mathematical enforcement of own-
ership through cryptographically bound state transitions.
• Consensus-Based Validation with forward-only, unforkable trans-
actions that achieve immediate finality through local verification.
• Certificate Authorities with cryptographic self-verification derived
from straight hash chain validation.
The system’s subscription-based economic model replaces unpredictable
gas fees with predictable storage-based pricing, aligning costs with actual
resource utilization while enabling gas-free transactions. Through its cryp-
tographic commitment structure and mathematical verification approach,
DSM provides selective privacy preservation while maintaining verifiability,
a combination that has proven elusive in traditional decentralized systems.
DSM introduces a robust decentralized identity and token management
system that leverages deterministic, pre-commitment-based state evolution
with quantum-resistant hash chain verification to achieve offline capabil-
ity, immediate finality, and superior scalability. By implementing bilateral
state isolation, DSM eliminates the need for global synchronization while
providing inherent consistency guarantees across intermittent interactions.
By utilizing a non-Turing-complete computational model, DSM system-
atically eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities inherent in traditional
smart contract execution environments, including unbounded computation
attacks and execution deadlocks, while still enabling flexible, dynamic work-
flows that can replace approximately 95% of conventional smart contract use
cases.
This architecture represents a fundamental paradigm shift in decentral-
ized execution models, enabling secure, efficient, and offline-capable trans-
actions without the computational overhead of on-chain execution or the
performance constraints of traditional consensus mechanisms. The integra-
tion of post-quantum cryptographic primitives ensures long-term security
against emerging computational threats, establishing a foundation for sus-
tainable decentralized applications.
92
The DSM protocol presents a mathematically sound, cryptographically
secure foundation for a truly decentralized, self-sovereign internet architec-
ture—one where users control their own digital identity, financial assets, and
online interactions without reliance on centralized authorities or vulnerable
trust relationships. This represents not merely an incremental improvement
to existing internet technologies, but a complete reconceptualization of the
trust layer that underlies digital interactions.
The future internet architecture will be trustless, mathematically secure,
and inherently sovereign. The future is DSM.
