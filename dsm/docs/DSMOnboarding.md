# DSM Onboarding Guide for Developers

Welcome to the Decentralized State Machine (DSM)! DSM provides a new paradigm for decentralized applications by combining off-chain execution with cryptographic state commitments. Here’s your comprehensive onboarding guide, including how to think strategically and plan your DSM applications effectively.

---

## 🔑 What is DSM?
DSM isn't a blockchain or a traditional smart contract platform. Instead, it uses:
- **Off-chain logic** (like writing regular Python or JavaScript code).
- **Cryptographic commitments** (proofs of state transitions).
- **No global blockchain state**, eliminating gas costs and security pitfalls.

## 🛠️ How DSM Differs from Smart Contracts

| Traditional Smart Contracts (Ethereum, Stacks) | DSM (Decentralized State Machine) |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| On-chain logic execution                      | Off-chain local execution         |
| Gas fees for every operation                  | No per-transaction fees           |
| Global consensus required                     | No global consensus required      |
| Complex security risks (e.g., reentrancy)     | Simple, secure, deterministic     |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Your DSM Environment

Install your language SDK (Python, JavaScript):

```bash
pip install blake3
```

### 2. Create Your First DSM State Commitment

DSM uses cryptographic hashing (BLAKE3) for all state transitions:

```python
import blake3

data = "your initial DSM state"
commitment_hash = blake3.blake3(data.encode()).hexdigest()
print("DSM Commitment:", commitment_hash)
```

### 3. Writing Your Application Logic

DSM apps are written in familiar languages:

```python
class SimpleDSMApp:
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state

    def update_state(self, new_state):
        self.state = new_state
        return blake3.blake3(new_state.encode()).hexdigest()

app = SimpleDSMApp("initial state")
new_commitment = app.update_state("updated state")
print("New DSM Commitment:", new_commitment)
```

### 4. Synchronizing and Verifying States

DSM states are easily verified by recomputing commitments:

- Generate your state commitment locally.
- Share the commitment via peer-to-peer, Bluetooth, or DSM's quantum-resistant decentralized nodes.
- Peers independently verify the commitment without needing global consensus.

## 🧠 Strategic Thinking & Planning DSM Apps

DSM requires strategic thinking and planning ahead:

### ✅ Planning Ahead for DSM
- **Determine your state variables** clearly:
  - What data is dynamic (e.g., transaction amounts)?
  - What conditions must be met (e.g., balance checks)?
- **Design your commitments** to represent the precise state and context.
- **Understand the sequence of your application logic** clearly before implementation.

### 📐 Multi-Step Actions and Precise Sequencing
DSM thrives in complex, multi-step scenarios. Here's how you should think about implementing these:

- **Stage your commits** clearly:
  - **Stage 1 (Initiate Action)**: Commit initial conditions (e.g., "user A requests transfer of 50 tokens to user B").
  - **Stage 2 (Intermediate Conditions)**: Commit intermediate checks (e.g., "user B confirms receipt conditions").
  - **Stage 3 (Final Action)**: Final commit reflects completion (e.g., "transfer confirmed, balances updated").
- Each commitment cryptographically references the previous state to form an unalterable chain.

### 🔀 Handling Dynamic Data and Variables
- Clearly define dynamic versus fixed data:
  - Amounts, user IDs typically dynamic.
  - Business logic rules, thresholds typically static.
- Commitments should precisely reflect state transitions ("what changed" and "why it changed").
- Ensure off-chain logic is deterministic: same inputs always produce the same output.

## 🔒 Advanced DSM Concept: Deterministic Verification & Security

DSM never directly pre-commits to the exact final hash. Instead, it commits explicitly to **conditions and deterministic logic** that will later produce a cryptographically verifiable final hash.

### 🧩 DSM's Deterministic Verification Clearly Explained:

1. **Initial Commitment:** Clearly defines conditions and logic without predicting the future exact hash.

```plaintext
Initial_Commitment = HASH(
  initial_conditions | provider_commitment | user_commitment | audited_logic_hash
)
```

2. **Final Commitment:** Generated after conditions are met, using verifiable actual events.

```plaintext
Final_State_Hash = HASH(
  Initial_Commitment | actual_action_completed | final_conditions_met
)
```

### 🚫 Why You Can't Fake or Forge DSM Commitments:
- The final commitment explicitly references a real and verifiable event.
- It’s impossible to generate the correct final hash without the actual, completed event.

### 🎯 Practical Example (Loan Repayment):

```python
# Step 1: Initial Commitment
initial_conditions = "User deposits collateral; provider repays loan"
initial_commitment = blake3.blake3(initial_conditions.encode()).hexdigest()

# Step 2: After repayment event (verified)
actual_event = "Provider repaid loan to user's DSM wallet"

# Step 3: Final Commitment (deterministic)
final_conditions_met = "Loan repayment confirmed via DSM"
final_hash_data = f"{initial_commitment}|{actual_event}|{final_conditions_met}"
final_state_hash = blake3.blake3(final_hash_data.encode()).hexdigest()

print("DSM Final State Hash:", final_state_hash)
```

This ensures DSM logic is cryptographically secure and clearly verifiable without any guesswork.
